PolinaJ’s scat like ear candy melody is what hooks listeners in
By
Amazon Customer
on April 5, 2016
Format: MP3 Music
PolinaJ’s most recent release showcases her wide array of eclectic influence throughout the last decade. This includes her takes on classic jazz and contemporary standards as well as her interesting and daring original compositions. The track I am most fond of on the record is Jerusalem, a composition that has a Middle Eastern feel to it. PolinaJ’s scat like ear candy melody is what hooks listeners in. Polina, through originally from Russia, spent some time in Israel for her musical studies. I assume during her time in Israel she was able to write this and other compositions inspired by her environment.
I was also quite fond of her beautiful scat intro to her cover of All Of Me. It showed magnificent melodic prowess through improvisation. She ends the record with a solid cover of Billy Joel’s New York State Of Mind. Being in New York for the last few years PolinaJ is definitely in a New York State Of Mind. As her last decade of Jazz and Pop comes to a close, she looks to use the exciting and vibrant environment of New York City to create a whole new decade of Jazz and Pop.

amazing voice!!!amazing album!!
By
Amazon Customer
on April 19, 2016
Format: MP3 Music
"Free from you" and "Lovers" I would say are two of my favorite songs, however I loved the whole album also. Polina has a very unique voice along with a strong piano skills which make her stand out from another artists.
I loved melody and lyrics and especially piano parts in these two particular songs. Her covers are great also, she was able to not just " copy" a song, but to make it sound totally different in her own way and " sorry seems to be the hardest word" sounds much better than an original version ( Elton forgive me please=)
Looking forward to see her new releases!

It was a great pleasure to listen to this album
By
Zhanna
on May 5, 2016
Format: MP3 Music
It was a great pleasure to listen to this album. Two songs I especially loved: original song "All of Me" and a cover version of "Sorry seems to be the hardest word". I'm a big fan of Elton John for many years, I absolutely adore this singer. PolinaJ's version of his song added colors of freshness and elegance! Thank you PolinaJ for your unique interpretation and wonderfully interesting voice!

Polina J is a unique artist...this is a very pleasant selection of songs...from NY State of Mind...one of my favorites...to the artist's "Jerusalem"  ...this is my favorite track on the album.  I love the energy and the vocal improvisation on this track!  Polina's music put me in a very "pleasant" state of mind.  Bravo!
