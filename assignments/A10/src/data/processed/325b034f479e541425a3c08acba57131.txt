Watch “Automaton” by Jamiroquai
Mandy
January 30, 2017
Music Videos
It was quite an avalanche of a New Music Friday this last week and whilst I’ve consequently been sifting through all the new content possibilities up for consideration. Incoming SHOCKER! I have to tell you that the
Martin Garrix
and
Dua Lipa
pop banging collab “
Scared To Be Lonely
” didn’t make didn’t make it through because truth be told, even though I love Dua’s commanding vocal performance, I found it all a bit too safe and formulated.
Jamiroquai’s “Automaton
” on the other hand is in! As Jay Kay’s ventured from the territories of acid jazz funk and gone all electronic and synthesizered up! Plus he’s bringing the headgear envy on with that illuminating, animated headpiece. Will we see Jay Kay become apparelled bit-by-bit in a transformer like shell of glowing body armour through the “
Automaton
” album campaign? This and other questions like, how does wearing a hat like that not hurt your eyes or give you a migraine?, may or may not be answered in the fullness of time.
Did we ever foresee
Jamiroquai
giving
Daft Punk
a run for their money?… In one short word – NO!
