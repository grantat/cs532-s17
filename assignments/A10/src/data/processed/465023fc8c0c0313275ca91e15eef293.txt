About Groove'n Arrels
Groove'n Arrels is an Internet Radio project that started in 2014, in Barcelona. It is committed to spread open-minded, rebel, and high quality music. Music is often the reflection of one's soul, of a culture. Real music is alive and carries a world of sensations and messages that can stand for daily therapy or social weapon.
Many sounds broadcasted on Groove'n Arrels are expressions of feelings for freedom and justice. They can appear as true calls for revolution, chanting down the dogma used to keep people in bondage for the benefits of oligarchies. Let us plant the seed of change in our minds. Let us do it in music, because music knows no boundary.
