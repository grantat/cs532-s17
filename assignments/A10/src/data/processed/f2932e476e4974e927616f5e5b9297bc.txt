Valerie June's eagerly awaited second album, The Order of Time, set for release in January 2017, justifies the immense promise she exhibited on her acclaimed debut, Pushin' Against A Stone. Unfolding like a novella, June sketches detailed, three-dimensional portraits of real people struggling with dreams, defeat, hope and life, in this 12-track song cycle. Musically, the genre-defying singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist has redefined herself again, infusing inspirations like Tom Waits, Nina Simone, Leonard Cohen and Fela Kuti into her unique blend of folk, blues, gospel and soul. As in life, a harrowing bite of bitterness can surely be felt in many of these songs and on others; June's ethereal soundscapes prove the perfect setting for her honeyed, childlike voice as she pleas for simplicity and a better world.

feeling like her songs are a natural part of our lives
By
Mark Chariton

Format: MP3 Music

Verified Purchase
The Order of Time is the next step in her climb up the Astral  Plane.  She has a unique talent to blend her music, lyrics and voice so all seem as one, feeling like her songs are a natural part of our lives.  Her first album Pushing Against a Stone got her the recognition, this album establishes her as an artist who is here to stay.  Enjoy!.

Best new artist album I have heard in 20 - 30 years!
By
Allan Elmore
on April 12, 2017
Format: MP3 Music
|
Verified Purchase
This is a great album! Absolutely captivating lyrics, singing and music! I have been collecting LPs (own 5000+) and CDs (own 1000+) for 60 years, beginning with Joan Baez and everything since (pop, folk, rock, classical, opera, etc.) -- and this is one of the very best I have heard in the last 20 years. Her voice, the accompaniment, the rhythm, the sonics -- it's all there! Few albums bring on gooseflesh any more -- but this one does. Get this album, you will NOT be disappointed if you have ears!
Update 4/20: I have been listening to this album for almost two weeks now and I continue to be impressed by it, and Valerie June. I keep hearing traces of Amy Winehouse, Billie Holiday, Van Morrison and even Elvis Presley (!) in what and how she sings. Her voice does have a sort of mysterious, surprising power to it, ranging as it does from almost scratchy highs to subtle, murmuring lows. And the songs have power, both as individuals and together as an album. Truly a great work of art.

Another Masterpiece by Valerie June
By
Lloyd G. Campbell
on April 2, 2017
Format: Audio CD
|
Verified Purchase
Valerie June's "The Order Of Time" is a refreshingly original, very listenable, rewarding recording.  It's clear that she's been influenced by all kinds of music and we're lucky enough to hear the synthesis that her music manifests.  It's fun to hear the versatility of her voice, including her growl, and the organic musicianship that supports her voice.  She's living in her music and enjoying it, and it comes across.  There are a number of songs on this recording, as with "Pushin' Against A Stone" that seem destined to be iconic.  Among my favorite songs are: "Long Lonely Road," "If And," "Astral Plane," and "With You," My only quibble is that "Just In Time" has too much of a Spector Wall of Sound feel, which, to my ear, doesn't have the original sound of the other songs.  I highly recommend this CD, as I do seeing Valerie June in concert.  She's fun and amazingly talented.

Great Album (give it a chance to work it's magic)
By
M. Northuis
on April 16, 2017
Format: Audio CD
|
Verified Purchase
My initial impression of The Order Of Time was that the songs were not
as instantly "catchy" as her previous outing--Pushin' Against.... Upon
repeated listening I found there are some fine songs here--The Love You
Once Made, The Front Door, Slip Slide On By. As with Laura Veirs
Warp & Weft album, the more you listen the more sense The Order.... makes
and the better it sounds (there are some fine arrangements here). Dare I say
she is the Macy Gray of folk/soul? A lot of the albums I have purchased this
year by some of my favorite artists have been a bit disappointing, but this album
is becoming my "go to" album for new music that inspires.....

Saw her in person in March. Fabulous singer/songwriter.  Great American music.  Ms. June is truly an 'original' artist who stays true to herself.  We all are the better for it.

A voice you just cannot forget once you have heard it. Beautiful arrangements, bluer than most that's out there but still uplifting. The sound of grace and sincerity. And as "Shakedown" proves, this lady can rock, too, and then some. What a woman!
