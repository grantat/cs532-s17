I was told from the previous owner that it is a 1999.  The serial number convention on these Marcus Miller models do not seem to follow the convention noted on Fender serial number dating sites.

The reason I ask is because I have a "B" SN MIJ Marcus Miller as well.
I also have the East Marcus pre in it too. It is a great bass. I got mine from a TB member back in 2009/2010, can't remember.
My best guess is that mine is a 2008 model.

Thanks.
Based on published serial number dating, the B would suggest a mid-1980s build, which clearly does not apply to these MM basses since they were not made until the 90s.
Great bass, for sure...just need to make my music gear life a bit simpler.
