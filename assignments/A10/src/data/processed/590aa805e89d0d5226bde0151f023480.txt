Pure Perfection!
By
Stewart E. White
on February 12, 2010
Format: Audio CD
|
Verified Purchase
There are not many times in one's life where pure perfection is experienced but the "Chris Botti in Boston" DVD and music CD is one of them. Before you even listen to the music or see the DVD, you experience a mastery of package design and photography; the inside and outside black and white triptych is a creative visual feast as is the content booklet which is hidden in the center section.
From the first note, you know that something special is unfolding because of a tremendous sense of staging and  audio space as created by the virtuoso master audio recordist, Al Schmitt, who should be considered the sixth member of Chris Botti's group.The other virtuoso artists in Chris' group include: Billy Childs-piano, Mark Whitfield-guitar, Robert Hurst-bass, and Billy Kilson-drums; masters all, each one bringing a unique talent to the event. Their synergy and energy synthesize into something unimaginable! All of this overlaid upon Keith Lockhart and the  Boston Pops Orchestra whose very name invokes its well known excellence.
As if all this wasn't enough, there are the guest appearances by Sting, Josh Groban, Steven Tyler, YoYo Ma, John Mayer, Katherine McPhee, Lucia Micarelli, Sy Smith, Dominic Miller, Russ Irwin. What  treasures and a splendid gift to the audience!
I won't even try to describe the performances in this work which are all beyond mere words so they must be heard.
I must also recognize the amazing multi-camera video work: the flying camera boom shots, the Steadicams, and every other implementation and process of the videomaker's art which left me breathless.
My personal experience? I am left with tears streaming down my face from the sight and sound of this magnificent work.

Got my time machine. Now what?

Well, there are lots of places to go if you have a time machine, but I'd probably start with Boston in the late summer of 2009. There, over a period of two days, the Boston Pops Orchestra held concerts featuring the inimitably smooth trumpeter, Chris Botti, accompanied by a cast of high-profile, high-talent musicians. I won't bother to list who sings what because you can look that up, but while you're back in Boston in 2009, what you want to keep your eyes and ears open for are Katharine McPhee's impeccable jazz phrasing (she's not a jazz singer, by the way), Yo-yo Ma's passionate and powerful cello, Sting's lively performance of his own songs with accompaniment from performers from the original recording, Lucia Micarelli's sweet violin (and her even sweeter plunge-to-the-waist evening dress), Josh Groban being Josh Groban, John Mayer doing a fairly impressive take on Frank Sinatra, Steven Tyler sounding like Aerosmith ("Cryin'") and not sounding like Aerosmith (Charlie Chaplin's "Smile"), and Sy Smith transporting us back to the `70's without a time machine with her funky rendition of The Look of Love. Pound for pound, Chris Botti has one of the clearest, resonant, and mellow sounding trumpets in the business, and he can blow it like nobody's business, too. High, low, muted, hand-cupped, all sound crisp and clear. He plays classics, jazz, funk, and pop, all with verve and confidence or reservation and serenity, whatever is called for by the song. His rhythm section is arguably one of the best jazz bands around and you won't find them slacking anywhere during the concert, but you will find them shockingly determined to outdo each other on Miles Davis' Flamenco Sketches, with Chris playing one of the three best solos you will ever hear played over this song. The winner, however, in my opinion, was guitarist Mark Whitfield, who takes you so far away from the song, you forget where you are, but when he brings you back into it, instead of transporting you to Spain, he just drops you in the middle of a bullfighting ring instead. Truly inspired playing and musicianship all around. While you're at the concert, pick up a T-shirt for me, please. What? You don't really have a time machine? Then I guess you'd better pick up this DVD/CD set, because without a time machine, this is the only way you're going to be able to experience this magical, unbelievable, stunning night of pure music performed the way music is meant to be performed: with soul, determination, and heartfelt gladness and appreciation that comes from sharing the music with an enthusiastic audience. I honestly don't think any fan of any music could be disappointed in any way by this CD and DVD. It will be many years before anyone is able to match the beauty and impressiveness of the wonderful musical performances in this collection. And you don't really think 115 5-star reviews out of 132 (before this writing) are wrong, do you? Just buy it.

A pleasant surprise

Over the years, the Boston Pops has hosted a large number of pop and jazz musicians.  Sometimes the combinations work, sometimes they don't.  This night, they pretty much did.  Similarly, when pop stars tackle jazz standards out the Great American Songbook, the results can range from magical to awful.  Here, the results stay in mostly in the middle, with some nice surprises.  Though far from my favorite song on this album, Steven Tyler's version of "Smile" at least proves that one should not compartmentalize musicians.
Before my top picks from this album, a few words about Chris Botti.  I admit having mixed feeling about his performances at times.  Make no mistake, he is a great "technical" trumpeter, with a rich, lovely tone.  What he sometimes lacks is the ability to really "swing"--either on ballads or "up" tunes--like he just doesn't "feel it."  On this album, though, he does better at "finding the groove."  So do the Pops and the guests, thanks in part to a first-rate rhythm section with Billy Childs on piano and Mark Whitfield on guitar leading the charge.
Now, for those "delights"--both surprises.  First, there is John Mayer singing the chestnut ballad, "Glad To Be Unhappy."  With a voice and delivery not unlike Kurt Elling, Mayer sings this ballad beautifully, with Botti taking a lovely solo.
The tune that takes the prize for the best on this album, though, is the Cole Porter composition, "I've Got You Under My Skin," most famously performed by Frank Sinatra with a sterling Nelson Riddle arrangement.  Here it shines with a swinging vocal solo by Katharine McPhee (who, if you watch the video of this performance, is also playfully flirting with the band and audience during the song--she definitely is a beauty).  Botti's short solo here echoes of Harry "Sweets" Edison's style--never playing two notes where one will do, swingingly playing the notes right on the beat.  He is followed by Mark Whitfield playing a swinging solo.  The Pops also swings this tune, pretty much following the original Riddle arrangement (hard to go wrong with that).
A nice bonus is Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah" played beautifully by Botti and Whitfield with just a sparse string accompaniment.  The only better version that I've heard is Sara Gazarek's luscious vocal version.
Overall, this is a very good album.  Hopefully, it will acquaint a new group of listeners to some of the great tunes out of the Great American Songbook and encourage some talented pop artists to explore jazz a little more.
