Skin Game
Drama · 1972 · English
Watch from $2.99
Posing as master and slave, likable swindlers Quincy (James Garner) and Jason (Lou Gossett) ride into backwater prairie towns in 1875. And after Quincy intones and Jason moans, Jason is sold to the highest bidder. Quincy later springs him loose and they split town, split the cash and head down the road to the next sucker. It's an effective scam for these smart and nimble schemers -- until they cross paths with an equally clever con woman (Susan Clark) and an irate former customer (Edward Asner). "What could have so easily been the most tasteless picture of the year turns out to be one of the funniest," the Los Angeles Times said about this comedy with a conscience. Enjoy the fun as two beloved and award-winning actors play roving rogues who put bigots in their place, all part of the Skin Game
