Great Vocals, you can't go wrong

I 'discovered' Devil Doll on Pandora the other day and was so impressed that I bought this album.  I wouldn't classify this as punk or alt or anything anyone has suggested. This women is a great Torch Singer, and the band plays in a number of musical styles, and they do it well, this says a great deal about the Singer and the band to be even capable of doing that and doing it well. The way the woman sings reminds me of the Torch singers of the 40s, her sultry voice will make your 'thighs go up in flames' why she is not more famous I do not know, but I think she is certainly a top 10 contender. This album is solid, there is not one song I didn't like, I have not heard there other albums, but if this is an example of what they do I will definitely buy more. If you are a fan of female Torch singers or female vocalists you can't go wrong with
Queen of Pain
p.s. for those of you more sensitive she does use the F word a few times.

Way better than expected! Amazon's preview clips do not do her justice!

I bought this after someone played Imelda May on the jukebox at the bar. I bought her album (More Mayhem) and this was a suggestion by Amazon. I kinda liked some of the song clips Amazon had as samples. I figured they would go well on a playlist of similar music together. I was not expecting to like this album so much! The samples of songs Amazon has do not do her justice! Not the kind of music I put on when my friends come over to party, but I love it when Im doing things around the house. Has an old time feel with new school content. Was not expecting to become a fan.

Sexy voice, original lyrics, but with an old-time feel.

Been looking for a sound like this for a while.  Part rockabilly, part torch song, with a dirty vibe.  Her voice is solid, and the musicians accompanying her here are excellent.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that after a while, the songs all tend to blend together, like subtle variations on a theme.  Bourbon in your Eyes is the stand out song.  Plus, 18 songs for $9 is a great deal.  She could have easily split that up into two albums.  I'm glad she didn't.

Fun and sexy

This is a great album that grows on me the more I listen to it. The band is fantastic (love the upright bass!) and I love Colleen's voice.
The songs are from all different genres, but they still have that jazzy, sexy, punk, quality that ties them all together and makes up the Devil Doll sound. I know that sounds odd, but after you hear it, you'll know what I mean. I'm not even sure how to classify it, maybe rockabillyjazzypunk?
My favorite song is probably Things You Make Me Do (great lap dance song). I also love 16 Days, Bourbon In Your Eyes, Driven To Distraction, and Liquor Store. All very sexy songs.
There really isn't a bad song on the album. Even the ones that I'm not that into are still very good.

Amazing album--Amazing live act.

I first became aware of Devil Doll while working at a club in Tucson, AZ.  I waslucky enough to have the night off and enjoy the show.  Since then I've not missed a live show of hers in the Southwest.  Like her live shows, this album is beautiful, breath taking, and down right impressive!  Devil Doll walks on the edge of Rockabilly, punk, and swing...she takes no prisoners in her captivating lyrics and voice.  She claims herself to sing about love with a jagged/tainted point of view.  In addition, Colleen (the lead singer and the preeminent'Devil Doll') is also a very accomplished musican.  Simply put this band is great, and the image of Devil Doll is right out of a 1950's pin up calendar!  ENJOY!

Love Devil Doll and wish she were still around.  Perfectly seductive and enjoyable, use this album when you want to take that night to the next level.  Turn it on and cook her dinner with a great bottle of wine and you will be a fan too.
