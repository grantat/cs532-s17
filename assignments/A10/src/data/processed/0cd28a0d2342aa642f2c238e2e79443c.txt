-- Fresh from releasing a beautiful cover of
Torey Lanez
massive hit
'Say It'
, Brookyn native
Ambri
releases the cover video to The God Father of Soul,
James Brown'
s classic hit '
It's A Man's World'
.  Ambri's soulful vocals are quite impressive and does justice to the record. When asked why she chose to cover the timeless classic she replied, "I'm very big on women empowerment. I loved the idea of recording a classic by a male legend such as The Godfather of Soul
James Brown
, that empowers women. This song also goes hand in hand with my first single, '
Wouldn't Be
' that I am releasing, which is why I call the cover song and video
'Man's World Part 1'.
The rising star is currently hard at work recording new music, taking interviews and gracing the red carpet at celebrity functions and industry mixers. Look out for her new single
'Wouldn't Be'
which will be premiering February 10th and her ep which will be released real soon.

About Ambri
In an industry that takes women and tries to package them into hyper-sexual products, females must keep a strong sense of self and rely on the quality of their music to represent who they are. Brooklyn based artist
Ambri
born Brianna Ra'nee McGraw embodies that, she is that rare artist who uses her gift of storytelling to share her art rather than selling sex. She has the ability to write and sing music that can appeal to the masses.  Ambri is redefining the meaning of an artist with her lyrical content and soulful vocals.
A Brooklyn, New York native, Ambri was raised in the church and grew up singing there and at all her school plays. She was encouraged by her parents and grandmother to pursue music. Each played a role in helping her to define her musical talent, by supporting her desire to sing and perform. When asked where it all began, she replied,  "My mother and grandmother had dreams of becoming successful music artists but ended up having children so they had to put their dreams on hold, working a 9-5. They supported my dreams and stood behind every decision I chose to make, no matter how tough it was. They understood the decisions because they shared the passion. They always push me to reach my greatest potential. Stood outside every audition line from sun up to sundown, 20 degrees to 100. No matter how tired, how sore, they supported my very huge dream. My mom is also the one who helped to teach me everything I know vocally and would make me go over a song a million times until I got that note right and perfected it."
Through out her school years she engulfed herself in all musical activities. She graduated from Brooklyn High School of The Arts as a vocal major, and from there she enrolled in
NYFA (New York Film Academy
) studying, musical theater.  While attending NYFA (New York Film Academy) she studied under the leadership of some amazing instructors who performed on Broadway and helped guided her career.
At the age of 14 she auditioned at the legendary
Apollo
theatre and performed a rendition of
Alicia Keys
smash hit "If I Aint Got You" and was chosen as the runner up. It was then she knew that music was her calling and that she wanted to pursue it professionally. She was so determined that she signed herself up to audition at shows such as,
American Idol, The X Factor, The Voice, Americas Got Talent
and
Michael Bivens Talent Search
.
Through her progression, it was clear that her talent went far beyond the ordinary. She mesmerized crowds when she performed.  Ambri's desire to become a successful artist became the driving force behind her music and she continued to practice her craft while fine-tuning her vocal ability and sharpening her melodic and lyrical skills.
Ambri has been influenced by some of the greats throughout music history, from acts like
Brandy, Whitney Houston, Beyonce, Janet Jackson, Anita Baker, India Arie
and
Aaliyah
. Her music can resonate with even the most scrutinizing audience, the inspiration derived from her musical taste is apparent. She is a creator who is meticulous in the songwriting process, reaching into the depths of her creativity towards self-expression. Music gives her a way to communicate feelings she may not otherwise express.
Ambri has collaborated with industry heavy weights like
Claude Kelly
and
Chuck Harmony
(Jessie J, Bruno Mars , etc.),
JFK
( Beyonce, Iggy, Teyana Taylor, Estelle, etc.),
The Order
(Beyonce 'Jealous', 'Drunk in Love'...just to name a few.)  Ambri's father was very instrumental in Ambri's success, he was able to leverage his industry contacts to broker her first record deal with
IMPACT RECORDS
under the leadership of
Michael (Make) Mentore
in 2014.
The soulful songstress is currently in the studio finishing up her musical project, shooting videos and gearing up to put together her first official showcase.
Ambri is on her way to musical success and will become a household name.
