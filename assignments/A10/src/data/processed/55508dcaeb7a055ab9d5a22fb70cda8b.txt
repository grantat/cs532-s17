Bill Evans gauges Donald Trump

From Bill Evans at Westpac today:
I have spent some time over the first week of my trip to the US with economists, officials and investors.
The general view is that growth in the US will gradually build through 2017; 2018 and 2019. That will be supported by easing financial conditions (tighter credit spreads and a rising share market to more than offset higher rates and a rising USD); rising business confidence; a lift in wages to reflect the fact that the labour market is at full capacity; and expansionary fiscal policy.
Rising wages, full employment and stronger growth will boost interest rates, with the FED tightening 2–3 times in 2017 and then 2–4 times in both 2018 and 2019. The peak in growth and interest rates is expected sometime in 2019, with the real Federal Funds Rate peaking around 1% (a zero real rate is seen as neutral).
After piecing together that profile, discussions usually shifted to the huge unknown – the policies of President Trump.
Despite my personal urging that infrastructure policy should be at the forefront of any initiatives, it was generally dismissed as being highly unpopular, with Republican senators seeing it as being too difficult to implement without a huge negative impact on the budget.
Early readings of Trump’s priorities indicate that health care; trade; tax and regulation are the focus. Personally I am attracted to the concept of an infrastructure bank, capitalised by a Federal Government guarantee.
That would seem to be a more practical approach than privatisation, where the complex relationships between Federal; state and local authorities vis a vis infrastructure assets means the time required to release funds through privatisation would be extremely long – i.e. many years.
Of course, privatisation policies should be embraced anyway, but doing so should not delay infrastructure initiatives.
All policy discussion was dominated by tax and trade. The base case on tax is taken to be the Ryan Plan which was released in June 2016 and contains some truly bold initiatives, including: cutting the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%; and consolidating personal tax rates into three brackets, 12%; 25% and 33%.
These policies are broadly in line with Trump’s less detailed assertions.
However, to make the package “saleable”, Ryan includes some radical changes in approach. Corporates are to be taxed on sales rather than earnings, with standard deductions such as depreciation; interest; state taxes; and advertising no longer deductible. Meanwhile, capital investment would be deductible in full in the year it occurred.
Of most controversy is the Border Adjustment Tax. Under this tax, companies would be exempt from tax on revenue from sales outside of the US. On the other hand, companies which purchase goods or services from outside the US would not be able to claim a deduction on those costs.
Effectively, the US, which runs a massive trade deficit, would be taxing that trade deficit at 20%. Importers would be under huge pressure, while exporters would be given a massive subsidy.
Implications for inflation; the USD; and the trade policy responses of other countries would be significant.
For example, some argued that the USD would appreciate by 20% to reflect an improved trade position, protecting the margins of importers. That would also contain inflation pressures and help dilute the opposition from other trading partners, especially China.
My discussions concluded that there is only around a 20–30% chance of such an arrangement being implemented. However, in recent days Mr Trump appears to have moved from a detractor of the policy to a supporter. Of course, all that can change again.
Such a policy, while hugely disruptive, would certainly be in line with his approach on trade, and could possibly have the support of Republican senators.
For markets, the implications for currencies; rates and equities would be profound.
These types of uncertainties complicate the central views on the economy and markets set out above. In particular, the impact on confidence of possible policy gridlock and speculation around developments such as the Border Tax will be central.

sounds like a pretty epic tax plan. I remember seeing Trump pre-election policies couldn’t be funded and going to 20% wouldn’t help.
to an accountant: what are pros/cons/macro effects of taxing revenue instead of earnings? how do you provide sector/policy tax incentives in that environment? sounds pretty radical.

Is it really taxing revenues – or just a change in the definition of “taxable income” by excluding some things that were previously deductible?
Pure taxation of company revenues would completely change the tax burden of most corporates – so hard to see the corporate-owned House and Congress letting this one through.  What is the purported benefit of making this change?  Seems a big roll of the dice…
The import tariff also sounds like a big risk – the impact would be to increase the cost of Americas imported goods to consumers (so much for tax cuts).  How would that go down with the American consumer/voter and would they blame Trump/Republicans?

See the One Nation 2% Tax on Revenues in the Australian context would actually generate more revenue for the authorities than under the current regime, and would free up considerable compliance issues that drag the ATO down. Certainly would be a popular move.

“would actually generate more revenue for the authorities than under the current regime”
Which is exactly what the corporates don’t want – and they will fight hard and dirty – MRRT and Carbon Tax spring to mind…
In the US corporates are well entrenched in the halls of power – hard to see pro-business Republicans taxing companies more – there’s a catch…

“Bill Evans guages Donald Trump”
Aren’t there laws against that sort of thing in most states in the US?

Does he actually believe this or is it a throwaway line intended as a sop to his (banking) master?  Shades of asset recycling from the late great Joe Hockey.

The move to taxing revenue instead of profit with day 1 write off for investment instead of depreciation write off over time and no deduction for debt financing costs would produce a very large shift in the debt/equity mix of corporates.  Not great for debt financing providers.
Debt funded ownership of assets, e.g. infrastructure deals presumably take a hit.
Software companies with a large revenue margin and development costs to recoup look vulnerable here.  Ditto miners with past sunk economic costs still being recouped by current revenues.
And … the real winner is equity funded property owners with rental incomes, especially if they have enough alternative income to fund new investments every year with their day 1 write downs.  The rich get richer, the poor get the picture.
But …hmmm … is this macro neutral?  If there is enough equity to replace the debt investment, and the equity is prepared to be done at lower return on equity due to deleveraging then well and good.  Lots of ifs there.  There is the potential that the overall investment is reduced due to higher after tax financing cost, depends how implemented.
Nil tax on offshore revenue and nil deductability re imported costs.  Surely offshore jurisdictions will retaliate against this crude beggar-thy-neighbour approach.  And I am sure domestic tax authorities would appreciate the opportunity to impact foreign based multinationals and their tax transfer pricing arrangements with nil deductability re imported costs. Some of which are US based I believe.
