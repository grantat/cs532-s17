Adored  for her singular magic for making what`s classic contemporary again, Jan Daley  is the most multi-talented and beautiful Best Kept Secret in entertainment  today. The triple-threat singer/songwriter, actress and playwright connects to  audiences worldwide with her authentic, personal presentations couched with  just the right amount of razzle dazzle to remind you why she`s at center stage.
As  usual, Jan is currently juggling projects in various performance arenas. Her  top priority is a new jazz-kissed easy listening EP
When Sunny Gets Blue
. The title track is her smoky rendition of the  classic ballad co-authored by her one-time songwriting teacher Jack Segal (with  Marvin Fisher), introduced by Johnny Mathis with the Ray Conniff Singers and  later recorded by many including Nancy Wilson, Anita O`Day and Kenny Rankin.  Jan`s version, which co-produced and co-arranged with Segal himself before he  passed away, is buttery smooth and drenched in sexy saxophone and is receiving  glowing nods at smooth jazz radio.
Reflecting  on Daley`s artistic excellence, Jack Segal assessed,
"Jan is a truly talented musician, singer and lyricist. Her marvelous  voice is selectively controlled and her intonation is immaculate."
Other highlights of the 5-song EP are a second chestnut from the pen of Segal  entitled "More Love" (Jan`s soaring vocal couched in a spellbinding musical  arrangement), the slinky, upright bass-driven "Cry Me A River" (on which Jan  works the low end of her range before getting some lovely alto scatting in -  co-produced by Craig Garfinkle) and Jan`s celestially spare self-produced  version of the torch standard "Skylark."
Jan`s cup also overfloweth with a holiday CD,
There`s Nothing Like Christmas
[featuring her take on Mel Torme`s timeless "The Christmas Song (Chestnuts  Roasting On An Open Fire)" and her self-penned "Can`t Give You Any Answers"],  the soundtrack of her recent stage production "Where There`s Hope" (love songs  that her dear friend Bob Hope introduced to the world via stage shows including  "I Can`t Get Started" and "I Won`t Dance") plus preparing a new show for a  February 2017 opening: "Broadway Lights Up The Silver Screen," in which she  will sing some of the all-time finest songs of the great white way interwoven  with transfixing tales of her one on one encounters with legends that made  them.
Billboard  raved,
" ... in every sense of the word, a  knockout!"
Variety proclaimed her,
" ... one of the most  entertaining, best balanced talent blends on the boards."

Once  crowned Miss California, Jan Daley began life as a bashful native of Inglewood,  CA, who slowly but willfully blossomed, parlaying her classical piano lessons  and dreams of becoming the next Doris  Day or Carol Burnett, into an enviable  string of gigs and experiences that have become touchstones of her career -  from Hollywood to Vegas to Broadway and many stops in between. Jan went from a  lanky local medal-winning competitive swimmer and Hollywood singing lessons to  sharing stages with the giants of giants of stage, screen, and (not sure if we should date myself or mention  Vaudeville) comic circuit including George Burns, Rodney Dangerfield, Don Rickles, and Hope.
She was also flown to Rome, Italy to be the originating vocalist of a song that  was nominated for an Oscar ("Till  Love Touches Your Life"), and has performed in stellar productions of  perennial favorite plays such as "Oklahoma," "Anything Goes" and "Taming of the  Shrew."
Jan  has also shared the screen with Bruce Willis, Peter Fonda, Alec  Baldwin and Tom Hanks in Forest Gump as well.
Along the way, Jan honed an intuitive skill for writing - songs and scripts -  that has served her as a chronicler and a torchbearer of bygone eras - able to  bring them back to vivid life via her words, her voice and her dynamic stage  performances.
