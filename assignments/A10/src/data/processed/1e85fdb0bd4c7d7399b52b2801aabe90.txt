Listen to Jamiroquai’s Daft Punk-inspired new single ‘Automaton’

STANDARD POST WRAPP BEGINS
Holy shit, it’s actually pretty great?!
After teasing their new album
Automaton
last week with
a trailer
that tipped its helmet to Daft Punk’s
Tron
soundtrack,
Jamiroquai
have unveiled their first, unashamedly robot-loving single in seven years.
‘Automaton’ premiered on
Jo Whiley’s
BBC Radio 2
show
last night (January 26) and it’s a vocoder-heavy slab of disco-funk that’s equal parts
‘
Supernature’
and equal parts Radio 1 A-list.
Even the hardiest of JayKay haters (me!) may even find themselves enjoying the track – if only for its similarities to Warp’s sci-fi IDM prince –
Jackson and His Computerband
. Memba him?!
The album
Automaton
is due for release on March 31. Listen to the track below.
