Fresh from releasing a beautiful cover of Torey Lanez massive hit “Say It,” Brookyn-native Ambri
releases the cover video to The God Father of Soul James Brown’s classic hit “It’s A Man’s Man’s Man’s World.”
Ambri’s soulful vocals are quite impressive and does justice to the record. When asked why she chose to cover the timeless classic she replied, “I’m very big on women empowerment. I loved the idea of recording a classic by a male legend such as The Godfather of Soul
James Brown, that empowers women. This song also goes hand in hand with my first single, “Wouldn’t Be” that I am releasing, which is why I call the cover song and video
“
Man’s World Part 1.”
Watch Ambri’s amazing cover below:
Ambri was raised in the church and grew up singing there and at all her school plays. Throughout her school years, she engulfed herself in all musical activities. She graduated from Brooklyn High School of The Arts as a vocal major, and from there she enrolled in NYFA (New York Film Academy) studying musical theater. While attending NYFA (New York Film Academy), she studied under the leadership of some amazing instructors who performed on Broadway and helped guided her career.
At the age of 14, she auditioned at the legendary Apollo theater and performed a rendition of Alicia Keys smash hit “If I Aint Got You” and was chosen as the runner-up. It was then she knew that music was her calling and that she wanted to pursue it professionally. She was so determined that she signed herself up to audition at shows such as, American Idol, The X Factor, The Voice, America’s Got Talent and Michael Bivens’ Talent Search.
Ambri has collaborated with industry heavy weights like Claude Kelly and Chuck Harmony (Jessie J, Bruno Mars, etc.), JFK ( Beyonce, Iggy, Teyana Taylor, Estelle, etc.), The Order (Beyonce ‘Jealous’, ‘Drunk in Love’…just to name a few.) The soulful songstress is currently in the studio finishing up her musical project, shooting videos and gearing up to put together her first official showcase.
