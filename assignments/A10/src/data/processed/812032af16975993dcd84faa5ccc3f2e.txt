iTunes Review
Heading straight to this album‚Äôs singles‚Äîrobo banger ‚ÄúAutomaton‚Äù and the sunshine pop of ‚ÄúCloud 9‚Äù‚Äîmight leave you thinking Jamiroquai have retreated from 2010‚Äôs live instrumentation-focused
Rock Dust Light Star
. Not so. While the mood is futuristic, the band's eighth album harks rewardingly back to their acid-jazz past. There are deep grooves, joyriding basslines, and sax freak-outs‚Äîbest packaged together for ‚ÄúVitamin‚Äù‚Äôs thrilling free-form jazz riot and the psychedelic ‚ÄúDr Buzz,‚Äù with its joyous, kitchen-sink outro.

The Return Of Jamiroquai (2017)
by
        
          AGLA
It's been 7 long years since Jamiroquai released their last studio album (Rock, Dust, Light, Star), but I must say "Automaton" is worth the wait!
I absolutely love "Automaton" this is pure feel good music done with signature Jamiroquai style. The is a must have addition for every Jamiroquai fan.
Best of all we can finally purchase our Jamiroquai fix in the USA iTunes Store!!
Now, if only Apple would add Jamiroquai to the 2017 "Apple Music Festival" this Summer I would be thrilled.
This will be on repeat for a long time. üé∂
Always Love Jamiroquai
by
        
          JR1969Z
I've been a big fan since 1996 or so. Saw them live at the Greek Theater in 1999 and again in Chicago in 2005.  What I love is how their music evolves and that they put their identity into each album even though each is has a different vibe. The single Autmaton is a further evolution of the space/funk/techno ride of A Funk Odyssey.  I can't wait to hear the new album.  Jamiroqui has legions of devoted fans, my only criticism is that it's been so long between albums.  My favorite band.
USA TOUR PLEASE!

Biography

Years Active:
'90s, '00s, '10s
Active since the early '90s, Jamiroquai have amassed a steady stream of hits in their native U.K. and experienced chart success in just about every other area of the world, with an irresistible blend of house rhythms and '70s-era soul/funk (the latter, especially, leading early on to claims of Stevie Wonder imitations). The band has gone though several lineup changes during its career, but through it all, their leader has remained singer/songwriter Jason Kay (aka J.K.). Born on December 30, 1969,...
