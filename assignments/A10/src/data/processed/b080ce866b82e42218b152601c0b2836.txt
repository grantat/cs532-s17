Huge selection of classic tunes for a low price
By
Chris Boylan
VINE VOICE

Format: MP3 Music

Excellent value for a huge number of popular tracks from the 1920s.  It's amazing how many of the songs from this era are still popular today ("Yes Sir, That's My Baby," "Singing in the Rain," "Ain't Misbehavin" just to name a few).
We got it for a 20s era gangster/moll-themed Halloween party and it was a big hit. I just mixed in a minute or two of "The Charleston" or "I Wanna Be Loved By You" or some of the other tunes in with modern music and the ladies would run out and do a few classic moves with their flapper wigs and gowns.
In terms of sound quality, it's reasonably clean.  These are older recordings so you're not going to get a lot of dynamic range or stereo imaging. But the tape hiss is pretty cleaned up without too many digital artifacts. For the quality and selection of the music itself, this is definitely a 5-star album.

Not exactly what I expected, a lot of instrumental pieces not so much vocal. Sound quality is okay, all in all if you are into 20s this is a nice collection.  I will probably also buy the Boardwalk Empire soundtrack (2 volumes).

Great selection, was perfect for what I needed it for...seating, cocktail and dinner music for a wedding.  The B&G; were havinga Roaring 20's themed party, and they were VERY happy with the music!
Sound quality suffers on some tracks, but this is either done on purpose, to give it the era feeling, or whoever produced this collection sucks in post!  Either way, very satisfied.  Would recommend!!

I wasn't born until more than 20 years from then, but this was the best fun..I knew many of the songs from the old movies. If you want to have fun and dance, this is the one for you.

The quality of the recordings is good considering the ancient, my age, recording practices. The mix is broad and there is something for everyone.
