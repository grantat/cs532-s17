4 Poofs And A Piano
4 Poofs and a Piano bring their unique blend of humour and superb vocals to the stage. After some time away from the limelight the camp house band from the BAFTA and comedy award winning Friday Night with Jonathan Ross on BBC1 are back on the road sharing their very special take on the modern world. The globally famous chat show aired on BBC from 2001 to 2010 extending to audiences in the USA, Australia, New Zealand and across Europe attracting a host of A list celebrities providing the boys with a few tales to tell. As household names, the 4 poofs and their piano featured in the ballets of Matthew Bourne and and the songs of Tim Minchin.
