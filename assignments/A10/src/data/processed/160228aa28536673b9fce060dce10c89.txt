Gboyega 'bug Z' Adeyemi popularly known as
Adegboyega
is a Pan-African Afro-jazz artiste from Nigeria. He is a talented musician and an incredible saxophone player with unique sounds that 'shout' Pan-Africanism through subtle-melodic and harmonious tunes. Adegboyega is no new kid on the block. He's been making African-oriented music since 2010 and has performed in major music festivals such as THE BEAT 99.9 FM MUSIC CONCERT and THE ALL AFRICA MUSIC AWARDS - AFRIMA 2016 alongside some of Africa's greatest music icons and legends.
Adegboyega's music is Afrocentric and catchy. It holds treasures of African culture and heritage eclipsed in Afro-fusion and Afro-futurism. His latest music video "
Faya Dance
" is a mesmerizing song inspired by the beauty and strength of the 21st Century Pan-African Woman. Shot at the
New Afrika Shrine
(venue of the world's prestigious FELABRATION MUSIC FESTIVAL),
Faya Dance
showcases the essence and passion for Afro-beats music and celebrates the diversity in different African cultures and ethnicity; a true testament to the actualization of Pan-African Unity and Solidarity using music as weapons of peace to propagate socioeconomic prosperity and cultural-exchange among peoples of diversity and beliefs. We strongly advise you get a bucket of water because this song is FIRE! Enjoy "Faya Dance" by
Adegboyega
and share in this wonderful experience of African music and culture at its very best.
Young inspiring talents like Adegboyega don't come around everyday. That's why we encourage everyone seeing this editorial to support this young Pan-African musician as best you can. Keep up with
