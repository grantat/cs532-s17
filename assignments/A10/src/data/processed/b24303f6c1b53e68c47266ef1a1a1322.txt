Smoke. Shadows. Moody strains of jazz. Welcome to the world of "noir musical" films, where tormented antiheroes and hard-boiled musicians battle obsession and struggle with their music and ill-fated love triangles. Sultry divas dance and sing the blues in shrouded nightclubs. Romantic intrigue clashes with backstage careers.
In her pioneering study,
Music in the Shadows
, film noir expert Sheri Chinen Biesen explores musical films that use film noir style and bluesy strains of jazz to inhabit a disturbing underworld and reveal the dark side of fame and the American Dream. While noir musical films like
A Star Is Born
include musical performances, their bleak tone and expressionistic aesthetic more closely resemble the visual style of film noir. Their narratives unfold behind a stark noir lens: distorted, erratic angles and imbalanced hand-held shots allow the audience to experience a tortured, disillusioned perspective.
While many musicals glamorize the quest for the spotlight in Hollywood's star factory, brooding noir musical films such as
Blues in the Night, Gilda, The Red Shoes, West Side Story,
and
Round Midnight
stretch the boundaries of film noir and the musical as film genres collide. Deep shadows, dim lighting, and visual composition evoke moodiness, cynicism, pessimism, and subjective psychological points of view.
As in her earlier study of film noir,
Blackout: World War II and the Origins of Film Noir,
Biesen draws on extensive primary research in studio archives to situate her examination within a historical, industrial, and cultural context.

excellent ground-breaking noir musical study
By
Walter Neff

Format: Kindle Edition

Verified Purchase
Another outstanding book by Biesen, the first work on noir musical films, a fascinating under-studied hybrid of film noir and dark jazz musicals. An extraordinary follow-up to Biesen's first book, Blackout: World War II and the Origins of Film Noir. Really interesting read, original scholarship with extensive primary archival research. Major films include Blues in the Night, To Have and Have Not, Phantom Lady, Gilda, The Red Shoes, Road House, The Man I Love, Black Angel, A Star Is Born, Young Man With a Horn, Young at Heart, Love Me or Leave Me, West Side Story, New York, New York, Cabaret, All That Jazz, Round Midnight, and many more. Well written film history, accessible to students, scholars, and movie buffs.

Couldn't Wait to Read This!
By
OpenBookSociety dot com
on June 1, 2014
Format: Kindle Edition
Brought to you by OBS reviewer JoAnne
Since I am a huge classic film – especially noir – lover; I couldn’t wait to read this book. Ms. Biesen has written an outstanding book on the use of music in film noir, and the impact it makes. Drawing upon such films as Gilda, Young Man with a Horn, Blues in the Night, Double Indemnity, and even The Major and the Minor - a film which uses the song “A Woman’s a Two Face” sung by a cadet to Ginger Rogers (masquerading as a teenager, believe it or not) – she has written a comprehensive and extensive work that is well-written and fascinating to read.
Anyone who is interested in film noir would find this indispensable as a reference – after all, who can forget Dooley Wilson in Casablanca crooning ‘As Time Goes By?’ She covers both well-known and not so well-known films - Christmas Holiday being one of my favorites – Gene Kelly and Deanna Durbin in a dark noir film, both playing against character (I suggest you try to find a copy; it will definitely be worth your while) – and offers a description of the Musician’s Strike of 1942, which has long since passed into history, yet spawned some of the greater singers of the century (Frank Sinatra among them).
A highly recommended book for both film fans and music lovers alike; after all, who can go wrong with a book that has the sultry Rita Hayworth as Gilda on the cover?

A Promising Concept Betrayed
By
Michael Samerdyke
on October 11, 2014
Format: Paperback
Opera is sometimes defined as an art form where someone is stabbed and then sings an aria.  Noir musical, perhaps, might be where someone is shot and then sings.
This was a frustrating book.  It could have been very good, because Biesen points out how flexible noir is as a category, and how closely it connects with the musical.  (Many noirs take place in nightclubs and have characters who are musicians, for instance.)  Music is an important part of film noir.
However, the book struck me as very badly organized.  Parts of it read like a pure history of film noir in general or even how Hollywood itself changed over the decades.  Some films were very thoroughly discussed, such as "Blues in the Night," which seems to have been the inspiration for this book.  Other films received perfunctory treatment.  Surely a book on music in film noir needs a detailed discussion of the "jazz nightmare" scene in "Phantom Lady."  Biesen breezes over that film and instead discusses "The Red Shoes" as a film noir.  While there is definitely a tragic element to "The Red Shoes," that movie has never struck me as film noir.
In her last chapter, Biesen talks about dark musicals that came out after "West Side Story" (which she also seems to consider noir) but she never mentions the neo-noirs of this era, whereas earlier she had always linked dark musicals to film noir.  I just found this chapter very unbalanced.
This book needed a strong editor.  (One little thing that bugged me.  Biesen said Winston Churchill died in 1955.  He did not; he left office that year.  Why would Churchill even be mentioned in a book on film noir in the first place?)  Ultimately, the book felt like Biesen was mashing a lot of her research together between one set of covers.  This could have been so much better.
