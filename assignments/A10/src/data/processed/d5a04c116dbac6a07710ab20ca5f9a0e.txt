About us
Anima Jazz Bar is a live music venue in Warrington that has performers from around the world headlining on a regular basis. We strive to ensure that our customers feel relaxed and that they all enjoy the welcoming atmosphere.
The name "Anima" Jazz comes from the Italian word for soul or spirit.  We want you to enjoy the soul, spirit that Anima Jazz has to offer.  Jazz has such a varied musical range that we play anything from classic jazz to jazz funk, soul and blues.
We have no dress code, why should we!  As long as you are relaxed and enjoy the music, that's all that matters to us. Come and enjoy the great vibe of the place, amazing cocktails, accommodating staff, delicious authentic Italian food.
We never rush you out of your seat to make room for other people, once you're in, you're in!  We have a main bar area downs stairs that has individual seating booths for either four or six, additional seating at the bar and two sofa seating areas for you to chill out in. It is in the down stairs are on a Friday and Saturday evening that we have the live music from 7pm, however we do transfer the band to the main stage area, up stairs, at around 9pm on busier evenings.
We hire out the main stage area for band pracice/rehearsal, private functions, meetings and it is also available for wedding hire. Pictures of the venue are available on our FB page, Anima Jazz Bar.
