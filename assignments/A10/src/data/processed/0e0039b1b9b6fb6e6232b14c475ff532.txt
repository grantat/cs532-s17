7 things, thoughts and/or feelings about Jamiroquai’s new single ‘Automaton’
No Comments
These weeks we have double party. First for
﻿﻿﻿Daft Punk's 'Homework' twentieth anniversary﻿﻿﻿
and now for
﻿﻿﻿﻿Jamiroquai's new single 'Automaton'
, the first track they've released in
six
(not seven, as some people say) years. And BTW some people have pointed out
common things
to both bands: let's see what might and might never be.
1. Jay Kay's hat has been
daftpunkized
In '
Aut
o
maton
' video you can see
Jay
Kay
(
Jamiroquai
's frontman) wearing a
hat
similar to the one he wore on '
Dynamite
' or '
Rock Dust Light Sta
r
'  (amerindian inspired) but transformed into some kind of
robotic
helmet
made of colour
lig
h
ts
and leds.
2. Is a hat with leds on it
enough
to
daftpunkize
the sound of a band?
Some media have said that
Jamiroquai
's sound is
daftpunkized
in this new single.
Jay
Kay
's hat could be
daftpunkized
due to all the lights and colours, but if you say the music is
Daft Punk-inspired
, then you never listened to '
A
Funk
Odyssey
' (2001), from the same year
Daft
Punk
released '
Discovery
'. In that record you can listen to
electronic
sounds
similar to those in '
Automaton
'. For example, the
vocoders
are almost the
same
. This question leads us directly to the
next
one...
​
​
3. ...Could we say that
Daft
Punk
jamiroquaized
in 2013?
If '
Automaton
' gave us reasons to say that
Jamiroquai
are
daftpunkized
,  we could say Daft Punk
jamiroquaized
in '
Random
Access
Memories
' (2013). Just listen to those
funky
guitars
and
basses
in tracks like '
Lose
Yourself To Dance
', '
Give Life Back To Music
' or '
Get Lucky
'. It's an
absurd
statement, like the one on the paragraph above. The main fact that leads to this
confusion
is there are lot more
Daft Punk
fans than
Jamiroquai
fans in the world.
4. Do
you
think it's seven years since Jamiroquai's last release? Then you forgot '
Smile
'
​
After '
Rock
Du
s
t
Light
Star
' (2010) came out and
Jamiroquai
were still touring​, they recorded a single, '
Smile
' (2011), which was uploaded to
Soundcloud
for everybody to listen free. That was really the last stuff we got from them.
5. '
Automaton
' is not at all the first
time
Jamiroquai show an electronic sound​.
We can refer again to '
A
Funk
Odyssey
' or some tracks from the eclectic '
Dynamite
' (2005): the
rap
part (when
Jay Kay
dances in the video) reminds clearly of '
Love
Blind
'. But you can also search through '
Synkronized
' (1999): '
Destitute
Illusions
' and '
Supersonic
' do sound electronic.
6. Wow! Is really Jay Kay
dancing
in the video?
There are a few
seconds
in the video that show
Jay
Kay
dancing
stunningly
, like he never did (I think he might be Jay Kay's
double
, but wish he's not). If you don't like the video or the
song
, at least you'll
enjoy
these few seconds. Really
awesome
.
7. Last Jamiroquai's album
,
'
Rock Dust Light Star
', had a lukewarm reception in 2010, so...
What could
happen
to this new album (coming out on
March
3
1
st
)? In these years, with
Bruno
Mars
bringing back the
disco
-
funk
sounds from the 80s and all those
DJs
putting
Electronic Dance Music
on the top of the charts,
Jamiroquai
's new single symbolise a
breathtaking
blend. It's always
controversial
when your band has the ability to attract
Daft
Punk
fans and
Red Hot Chili Peppers
fans at the same time:
some
fans are still expecting
Jamiroquai
to do the
same
they did in 1993, pure smart
Funk
. '
Automaton
', in spite of the
disco
-
funk
bassline from the chorus and some
guitars
, speaks on the
contrary
, but they still
hope
this single it's just a
bait
.
The vast
majority
approve this single and expect
Jamiroquai
's upcoming album to find the perfect
balance
between pure
funk
, pure
power
, pure
dance
, pure
feelings
and pure music. And BTW to become one of the
best
of 2017. We've just waited for a
long
time
!
