Jamiroquai
January 30, 2017
Music
I love
Jamiroquai
.  I know a lot of people who only know the band for
Virtual Insanity
(or perhaps
Canned Heat
because of its use in
Napoleon Dynamite
), but they have a whole slew of songs that are really damn good.  Maybe I should make a mix?  I should make a mix.
Anyhow, today I have the video for the band’s latest attention-grabber.  It’s the title track off of their upcoming album,
Automaton
, which is due out March 31.  Expect to want the hat that Jay Kay is wearing.  Enjoy.

There's also a guy here who brought his own tambourine. He's pretty solid.
