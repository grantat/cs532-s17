Lester leaps in
By
bob meier

Format: Audio CD

This goes against almost everything I have read about Lester-that his Basie recordings are the ones to get and that after the forties he was a shadow of himself.
I've heard the Basie recordings and they didn't do a whole lot for me. But I LOVE this cd. Peterson and bass player(Roy Brown?) give perfect support to Lester who sounds like he is effortlessly winging it-like the jazz master that he was. This was recorded in 1952-maybe there was a slide
after that but you wouldn't know it from these recordings. Perhaps I just prefer a small group format to a big band.  For me this is as good as Ben Webster's record with Peterson

A Verve Remaster From 1952
By
Liam Watson
on February 20, 2014
Format: Audio CD
|
Verified Purchase
This remastered re-issue brings together all of the recordings from November 28, 1952 of Lester Young and the Oscar Peterson Trio including a false start of "I Just Can't Get Started". Also it contains the original cover of the album which is a lot friendlier than the cover on the "The President Plays" title from 1989. All the songs are an outstanding performance and feature mainly love songs. Peterson and Barney Kessel perform extraordinary solos on "Ad Lib Blues", "Just You, Just Me", the upbeat "Tea for Two", "Back Home Again in Indiana", and "I Can't Give You Anything But Love." The slow ballads have a very strong romantic feel with Young's raspy tone on his sax. One exception from Young's other studio recordings are his vocals on "(It Takes) Two to Tango" which came from "The President Plays". Though it may sound a little sexist, it still is a good parody version of the song. Very recommended for lovers.

Ethereal, Sweet @ Swinging
By
JG
on January 11, 2007
Format: Audio CD

Verified Purchase
This Verve master edition is a beautifully done package and deserves a place in any music library as one of the bonafide classics of jazz recorded in 1952.
The sparse sweet nature of the jell of these musicians here is amazing stuff and for those new to Lester Young, an icon whose sax is one of the benchmarks of his genre,you won't be sorry because these recordings are a historical document comprising basically two 10 inch LP issues, an LP
and a couple of "sly curios" and banter with Oscar Peterson and his men.
The standards covered are transformed and when heard, the opening Ad Lib Blues composed by Young sets the next hour of this CD right.
Needless to say, Oscar Peterson is another piano giant and the total package includes booklet, all wonderfully remastered, and as the notes within say is a collection that ranks with Ellington's Okeh material, and Armstrong's Hot 5 and 7's..not that those are the only great times those men recorded..just as Young's work, they did not call him Pres for nothing.

Should be 6 Stars
By
J. S. Geers
on January 11, 2006
Format: Audio CD

This recording,  made in the years that were allegedly not his very best, demonstrates absolutely that Willis Lester Young is indeed the President of the Saxophone.  Young's effortless sweet swing flowing along with Oscar Peterson and highlighted with some great guitar work by Barney Kessel will hook you.  A special bonus is the President's humor displayed in his vocalizing on Two to Tango.  The re-master quality is excellent.  There are lots of players who played more notes and had a "bigger" sound.  Young was replaced by Coleman Hawkins in Basie's band partly because Hawkins blew louder.  But for making every note count, wonderful melodic invention and great rythmic surprises, for absolute mastery of the horn, Lester Young takes second chair to none.  Nearly every tenor player since the 30's has cited Young as an influence.  Listen to this CD and you will know why.  Buy it today and love it for a very long time.

Lester Young also well known for playing with Count Basie band, but this is him with just a small group so you hear his great sax up close and personal.  Sure, the piano and guitar playing is nice, they all are spectacular but that sax, that's why you want to keep listening.  This is a very enjoyable jazz recording.
