Jamiroquai is back, and as they say, they are bigger and better than ever. THE electronic soul funk superstars also announce their return with their eight studio album, ‘Automaton’. Written and self- produced by Jay Kay and Jamiroquai keyboard-maestro Matt Johnson which shall be available by end of March.
Causing a swarm of excitement from fans across the globe, after the release of ‘Automaton Transmission 001′, Jamiroquai has now released the full length video for the album’s title track too, as well as dropping a stunning remix from Swiss don Deetron which is arguably one of his finest reworks to date. Sometimes a bit dreamy, string heavy and sweet, this still is a dark masterpiece of a psychedelic funk record that stands out from the rest. Causing a stir on any dancefloor I have dropped it to date, this is a battle weapon for any DJ and a great move from EMI Virgin too, as they eventually commission a serious House Mix rather than any sellout EDM remix. Good!
