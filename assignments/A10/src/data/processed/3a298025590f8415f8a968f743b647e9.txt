AJ Radio is my "online" radio station.... it should be running in the background at the moment.
Your browser does not support the audio element.
Use the buttons to turn it down if it is too loud for you!
The station plays a mix of music from the 50's, right through to the present day, and is (at the moment) commercial free.
The site webpage, accessible
here
is currently undergoing a complete redesign.
