Honey,
You're sweeter

Want to get closer to you

Nightly,
So tightly,
Girl you know you really blow my mind
Say it again,
Just one more time
I've got to know,
How you came to blow my mind
Closer
Pleasure, passion
Tonite's the night I'm looking for your action
I want to hold you,
Don't you know now you blow my mind
Say it again,
Just one more time
I've got to know,
How you came to blow my mind
Closer,
Fever, hot now,
Help me wipe the sweat away from my brow,
Sexy
Oh lady,　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Don't you know this time you blow my mind
Oh don't you know yeah,

Oh yes you do

You know this boogie is for real
I used to put my faith in worship
But then my chance to get to Heaven slipped
I used to worry about the future
But then I threw my caution to the wind
I had no reason to be care free
No no no, until I took a trip to the other side of town
Yeah yeah yeah, you know I heard that boogie rhythm
Hey, I had no choice but to get down down down down
Dance, nothing left for me to do but dance
Off these bad times I'm going through
just dance
Got canned heat in my heels tonight, baby
I feel the thunder, see the lightning
I know this anger's heaven sent
So I've got to hang out all my hang-
ups
Because of the boogie I feel so hell bent, hey hey
It's just an instant gut reaction, that I got
I know I never ever felt like this before
I don't know what to do
But then that's nothing new
Stuck between hell and high water
I need a cure to make it through
Hey dancing nothing left for me to do but dance
Off these bad times I'm going through
just dance
Hey got canned heat in my heels tonight baby
You know know know I'm gonna dance yeah
Off the nasty things that people say
Dance yeah but I'm gonna make it anyway
Dance yeah got canned heat up my heels tonight baby
You know I've got canned heat up my heels
You know this boogie is for real
Only the wind can blow the answer
And she cries to me when I'm asleep
She says you know that you can go much faster
I know that peoples' talk can be so cheap
I got this voodoo child inveined on me
I'm gonna use my power to ascend
You know I got these running heels to use
Sometimes there's no way I lose
I was born to run and built to last
You've never seen my feet cause they move so fast
Dance yeah, hey nothing left for me to do but dance
Off these bad times I'm going through
just dance
, hey
Got canned heat in my heels tonight baby
Hey I've got to dance yeah
Off the nasty things that people say
Dance yeah, but I'm gonna make it anyway
Dance yeah, got canned heat up my heels tonight baby
You know this boogie is for real, got
So much canned heat in my heels yeah
Gonna dance, gonna dance my blues away tonight
You know I'm gonna dance my blues away
You know this boogie is for real, got
So much canned heat in my heels yeah
Gonna dance, gonna dance my blues away tonight
Dance, come on got canned heat in my heels tonight
Oh oh oh oh, canned heat in my heels tonight
Oh oh oh oh, canned heat in my heels tonight baby

Oh yeah, what we're living in (let me tell ya)
It's a wonder man can eat at all
When things are big that should be small
Who can tell what magic spells we'll be doing for us
And I'm giving all my love to this world
Only to be told
I can't see
I can't breathe
No more will we be
And nothing's going to change the way we live
'Cause we can always take but never give
And now that things are changing for the worse,
See, its a crazy world we're living in
And I just can't see that half of us immersed in sin
Is all we have to give these
Futures made of virtual insanity now
Always seem to, be governed by this love we have
For useless, twisting, our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound for we all live underground
And I'm thinking what a mess we're in
Hard to know where to begin
If I could slip the sickly ties that earthly man has made
And now every mother, can choose a color
Of her child
That's not nature's way
Well that's what they said yesterday
There's nothing left to do but pray
I think it's time I found a new religion
Whoa, it's so insane
To synthesize another strain
There's something in these
Futures that we have to be told.
Futures made of virtual insanity now
Always seem to, be governed by this love we have
For useless, twisting, our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound for we all live underground
Now there is no sound
If we all live underground
And now it's virtual insanity
Forget your virtual reality
Oh, there's nothing so bad. (happiness)
Oh yeah
I know yeah
Oh this virtual insanity we're living in
Has got to change, yeah
Things will never be the same
And I can't go on
Well we're living, oh oh
Virtual insanity
Oh this world has got to change
'Cause I just, I just can't keep going on
In this virtual, virtual insanity
That we're living in, that we're living in
That virtual insanity is what is
Futures made of virtual insanity now
Always seem to, be governed by this love we have
For useless, twisting, our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound for we all live underground, oh
Futures made of that virtual insanity now
Always seem to, be governed by our love
For useless, twisting, of that new technology
Oh, now there is no sound for we all live underground, yes we do
Virtual insanity is all we ever know
Yeah is all I have

I must've died and gone to heaven
'Cause it was a quarter past eleven
On a Saturday in 1999
Right across from where I'm standing
On the dance floor she was landing
It was clear that she was from another time
Like some baby Barbarella
With the stars as her umbrella
She asked me if I'd like to magnetize
Do I have to go star-trekking
'Cause it's you I should be checking
So she laser beamed me with her cosmic eyes
She's just a cosmic girl
From another galaxy
My heart's at zero gravity
She's from a cosmic world
Putting me in ecstasy
Transmitting on my frequency
She's cosmic
I'm scanning all my radars
We'll she said she's from a quasar
Forty thousand million light years away
It's a distant solar system
I tried to phone but they don't list 'em
So I asked her for a number all the same
She said, step in my transporter
So I can teleport ya
All around my heavenly body
This could be a close encounter
I should take care not to flounder
Sends me into hyperspace, when I see her pretty face
She's just a cosmic girl
From another galaxy
My heart's at zero gravity
She's from a cosmic world
Putting me in ecstasy
Transmitting on my frequency
She's cosmic
Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face
Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face
Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face
Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face
Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face
Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face
Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face
Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face
She's just a cosmic girl
From another galaxy
Transmitting on my frequency yeah cosmic, oh
Can't you be my cosmic woman?
I need you,
I want you
to be my cosmic girl
For the rest of time

Everything is good
And brown
I'm here again
With a sunshine smile upon my face
My friends
Are close at hand
And all my inhibitions
Have disappeared without a trace
I'm glad
That I found
Somebody who I can rely on.
This is the return
Of the
space cowboy
Inter-planetary
Good vibe zone
At the speed of Cheeba
You and I go deeper
Maybe I'm gonna have to get high
Just to get by.
You know I've got that
I got that cheeba-cheeba kind of
space cowboy
vibe
Everything is good
And green
Say, I'm red again
And I don't suppose I'm coming down
I can see clearly
So high in the sky
A man with psychedelic picture frames
Of happiness to shade
His eyes
He's glad
That he found
Somebody who
He can rely on.
