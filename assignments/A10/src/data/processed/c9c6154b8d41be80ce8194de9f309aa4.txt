Wax Time Unauthorized Reissues
By
mattmattmatt
on April 24, 2014
Format: Vinyl
|
Verified Purchase
I bought this and a few others of these Wax Time reissues which the interwebs claim are sourced from CDs and NOT authorized from original 50s masters. I'm a professional musician but an amateur audiophile and was kind of disappointed that these were reproduced in Spain from CDs of public domain recordings not actual masters. These reissues are widely available for around $10-13 so caveat emptor. I'm less concerned that the extended estates and publishing interests of the original artists won't be paid for these recordings--AFAIK many of them weren't compensated fairly while they were alive. But from the perspective of someone who wants to own something "legit," it does bother me that these Wax Time reissues are broadly viewed as a joke.
Having said all that, I'm actually very happy with the quality of these bootlegs. The vinyl is heavy and flat. I've bought three and none were warped and all had nice sleeves, jackets and artwork. These aren't garbage records, but they're not at all the audiophile quality they claim to be. If you want to enjoy these recordings on a turntable, these are fine. But buyers should look into the whole story on these Wax Time reissues before buying.

Ella & Louis is Absolutely Wonderful
By
Inspired Dribble
on July 4, 2013
Format: Vinyl
|
Verified Purchase
The song selection and recording quality of the "Ella & Louis" vinyl LP is far far above most LP's out there today and is one of the best sounding LPs that I have heard (specifically, I am talking about the LP labelled import, pressed by 'Waxtime').  The recording is warm and filled with feeling and has a rare dimensional depth and soundstage with a "live -  in your living room" quality and presence, - and the selection of songs shows the extraordinary warmth and dynamic that the two have together.  It is easily one of the best recorded and mastered LPs I have heard.
The Ella & Louis LP is an absolute must have for anyone who likes Jazz, Ella or Louis, or truely great music in general.  The music spans generations and will appeal to all lovers of great song and artistry.
If you were wondering if you should get this LP, don't hesitate.  Just buy it.  It is destined to be a classic and I recommend that you get it before people realize just how great the LP is and it becomes in short supply.
By the way, this Ella & Louis LP (the one where the cover shows Louis with 'wader' pants pulled up by sitting in a chair and 1950's white socks showing, Waxtime label) is much better sounding and better mastered than the double vinyl LP "Together - Ella & Louis" (with a blue toned cover) which, although not bad, sounds a little lean and digital, and is lacking depth in comparison to  the better sounding single LP  "Ella & Louis" reviewed here.

I'm only 23, but I'm a bit of an old soul. There's not much I won't listen to, from Nina Simone, Edith Piaf and Billie Holiday to Elvis, Sinatra, and Jimmy Durante. If you enjoy listening to real music or you're just exploring, get the album. There's nothing bad I can say about this album. I am as in love with this album as I am in love with Ella and Louis themselves.

Great recording of these 2 geniuses
By

Format: MP3 Music

Verified Purchase
OMG, who could not love this!  From the very first note, you can feel the genius of these 2 people.  I can't comment about the sound quality of the recording because I'm not a true audiophile.  I always maintain that the magic happens in my head, not in my speakers.  It's a good enough recording so that there was lots of magic happening.

A must have for any lover of Ella and Louis and the Great American Songbook - Doesn't Get Any Better
By
Mike Agron
on November 2, 2014
Format: Vinyl
|
Verified Purchase
Doesn't get better than Ella and Louis singing great classics from the Great American Song Book.  All of the cuts are top rate, and my absolute favorite is A Foggy Day.  Listen how Louis starts the song with his great voice, then a little musical interlude and wham, Ella comes in with that incredible voice, phrasing and just sings the hell of out lyrics, then Armstrong does his instrumental, and they finish it. For this cut alone, the album is worth it.  This is the 3rd version of this pairing I've bought in the last 20 or 30 years, starting with the first vinyl, then a CD, then this version, is again top shelf.

Bought this for some friends of mine. They loved it. I am also a fan of Louis Armstrong and got to listen to them play it the first time (I do not own a record player, but they are record enthusiasts), and it played wonderfully and the music was obviously fantastic.

Excellent
By
Robert
on May 29, 2014
Format: Vinyl
|
Verified Purchase
After listening to their songs in MP3 format repeatedly I decided it was time to invest in the vinyl version of Ella Fitzgerald & Louis Armstrong, two of the smoothest voices to have ever existed (in my humble opinion). Tonight while cooking dinner I put the record on and was more than pleased with the excellent sound quality and the songs in general. Plus, whenever I play the blues my man always takes the opportunity to dance me around the kitchen while our Basset Hound watches.
It is an album well-worth the purchase price and is an excellent addition to any vinyl collection.
-Brittany (Robert's significant other)

If you don't like Ella and Louie, you can just get out!
Great record, and so lovely to hear on vinyl. Brings back some good memories.
The record is great quality (thick vinyl for better sound quality, and doesn't feel like it's likely to break by lifting it) and the packaging is top notch (remember the record sleeves with the plastic in the middle? Of course you don't, but they happened, and this has it too)
