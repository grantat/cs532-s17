As I am semi-retired I have plenty of time to wander the back roads and country lanes in search of photographic subjects. Often I find myself returning to this quiet lane to photograph the seasons and the majestic old shade trees that line the dusty road. I waited for just the right weather and light to capture this photo of the old man of the lane.
Nikon D700, F2.5, 1/4000 sec., ISO 200, Spot Metering, Exposure Comp. -1 step, Lens Nikkor 50 mm. 1.4,  Aperture Priority

James L. Brown is a neophyte, mostly self taught photographer that strives to bring out the beauty in simple things and subjects. Although he really likes gear, he believes vision is what really matters in photography.  He hopes some day to use my photography to help those less fortunate in this world. He is always looking for new members for his KIVA Photographerfriends lending team http://www.kiva.org/team/photographerfriends
