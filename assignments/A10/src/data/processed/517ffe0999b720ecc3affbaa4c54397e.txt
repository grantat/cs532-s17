Jamiroquai
are once again giving us something, announcing their first album in seven years
Automaton
, after
teasing it
throughout the week.
The British band headed by Jay Kay will release the new record on 31st March and they’ve preceded it with the funky title track.
Jamiroquai released their last record
Rock Dust Light Star
back in 2010 before going quiet for a little while.
They’re back in full swing now though announcing 13 live dates on top of the album. Unfortunately, Australia isn’t included in those dates but hopefully it won’t be long before you love fools get to see Jamiroquai in the flesh.
“The inspiration for Automaton is in recognition of the rise of artificial intelligence and technology in our world today and how we as humans are beginning to forget the more pleasant, simple and eloquent things in life and in our environment including our relationship with one another as human beings,” Kay said about the record.
Hear the new single below.
