We are Planet 90
Internetradio with the real sound of the 90's!
Time flies by these days, we all know that feeling…right? Sometimes you’ve just got to emerge yourself in the sound of the 90’s and pump up the volume!
Do you remember the first time you went online, the outrageous clothing, the new music phenomena like house and hip hop and all the other things that were trending? It was an era of revolution in many ways.
In 2004 we started streaming 90’s music 24/7 online, we didn’t play a specific genre, if it was from the 90’s we played it: R&B, Hip Hop, Hiphouse, Swingbeat, Dance, House, Rave, Happy Harcore, Rock, Pop. Nowadays our playlist exist of only songs that we rate as 90’s Dance music. Not only the mainstream European dance hits, but also the special mix versions and songs that were big in countries like the USA or the UK. We like to keep you surprised!
We also will keep you updated with news about artists from that era and activities from our dj’s. Join the Planet 90 social media and connect with our dj’s and other listeners.
We all love the real sound of the 90’s!
