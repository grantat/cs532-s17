Check the actual bass cover out here! Leave a like if you dig it :)
The audio for this bass cover sadly got claimed by UMG. You can find the video with the actual audio in the link above :)
Give this vid a like and a share if you dig it!
The new Jamiroquai single just dropped and since I'm a longtime fan of their work, I just had to do a cover of it. Really digging the tune and can't wait for the record to be released. Let me know what you think!
