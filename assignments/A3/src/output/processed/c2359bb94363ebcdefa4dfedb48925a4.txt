Gerry Rafferty
artist pic
Gerald Rafferty (born on April 16, 1947, in Paisley, UK, and died on 4 January 2011) was a Scottish singer-songwriter. In his early years, Rafferty earned money by the formerly illegal practice of busking on the London Underground. Poetically, his biggest hit, 1978's "Baker Street", discusses busking at a tube station and being a part of the street life. After working with Billy Connolly (now better known as a comedian) in an obscure outfit known as The Humblebums, he released his first solo album, called 'Can I Have My Money Back', in 1971. That collection of folk inspired tunes gained some notice for its deliberately 'old-timey' cover art.
In 1972, Rafferty and his old school friend Joe Egan formed the outfit Stealers Wheel, a group that proved beset by legal wranglings yet brimming with talent. They had a huge hit with "Stuck in the Middle With You", a pop/rock track deliberately aping the style of Bob Dylan that has had massive airplay for decades. That song also was immortalized in the infamous torture scene in the motion picture 'Reservoir Dogs', the film's soundtrack introducing the group to a new generation. Despite their knack for The Beatles-like melodic rock, Stealers Wheel disbanded in 1975.
Rafferty spent quite a while in a sort of forced legal limbo before he could record again, spending his time wisely as he developed his sound. In 1978, Rafferty cut a solo album, 'City to City', which would catapult him right into international stardom. Earning praise from many music critics, the release included the song with which he remains most associated: "Baker Street". Known for its gripping lyrics and haunting saxophone solo by Raphael Ravenscroft, the single reached #3 in the U.K. and #2 in the U.S. The album itself also received a boost as another single, "Right Down the Line", picked up major attention.
"Baker Street" has remained a mainstay of radio airplay for decades and popped up several times in popular culture, an example being its placement in the 'Good Will Hunting' soundtrack. Notable cover versions include a release by Undercover that also made the Top 3 in the U.K .singles chart in 1992. American rockers Foo Fighters also made their own version, swapping the saxophone solo for a guitar solo.
His next album, Night Owl, also did well, and the title track was a UK No. 5 hit in 1979. The follow-up single "Get It Right Next Time", made the UK Top 40.
Subsequent albums, such as Snakes and Ladders (1980), Sleepwalking (1982), and North and South (1988) all fared less well, due partly to Rafferty's general reluctance to perform live. "Don't Give Up On Me", from his 1992 collection On A Wing and a Prayer, is a much-featured oldie on BBC Radio 2.

One of my favorite songs. A fantastic example of polished, 70's pop at it's best. Rafferty had such a uniquely sweet voice that really took on a special dynamic when double-tracked. Every time I listen to Baker Street I hear different things - behind the fantastic vocal, absolutely EPIC Sax hook and the scorching guitar lead are many gorgeous layers of orchestra, acoustic guitar, synth, lots of percussion, even some backwards guitar in there too - an epic song that for me will forever be the Jersey Shore, 1978 - timeless perfection.

It's a brilliant song, unlike anything else out there. It was genius to use the sax in the way it was used, but very daring for the time because when the song came out pop music consisted of nothing but electric guitars. Saxophones were considered a relic of the 1950s rock and roll scene.
Rafferty did two other really epic songs --
Stuck in the Middle with You
and
Right Down the Line
