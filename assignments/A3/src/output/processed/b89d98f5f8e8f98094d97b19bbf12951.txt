Listen to Jamiroquai’s Daft Punk-inspired new single ‘Automaton’
27 January 2017
Holy shit, it’s actually pretty great?!
After teasing their new album Automaton last week with a trailer that tipped its helmet to Daft Punk’s Tron  soundtrack, Jamiroquai have unveiled their first, unashamedly robot-loving single in seven years.
‘Automaton’ premiered on Jo Whiley’s BBC Radio 2 show last night (January 26) and it’s a vocoder-heavy slab of disco-funk that’s equal parts ‘Supernature’ and equal parts Radio 1 A-list.
Even the hardiest of JayKay haters (me!) may even find themselves enjoying the track – if only for its similarities to Warp’s sci-fi IDM prince – Jackson and His Computerband. Memba him?!
The album Automaton is due for release on March 31. Listen to the track below.
