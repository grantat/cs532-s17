Stream the title track now.
Having teased their new album last week, Jamiroquai have officially announced the release of their eighth studio album
Automaton
.
A retro-futurist slice of Daft Punk-inspired robo-funk, the album’s title track features a video directed by Björk and Arcade Fire collaborator Charlie Lightening, and see’s Jay Kay don another piece of elaborate headgear, swapping virtual insanity for virtual reality.
“The inspiration for
Automaton
is in recognition of the rise of artificial intelligence and technology in our world today and how we as humans are beginning to forget the more pleasant, simple and eloquent things in life and in our environment including our relationship with one another as human beings,” Jay Kay said.
The 12-track LP
Automaton
will be released on double heavyweight vinyl via Virgin EMI on 31st March. Click
