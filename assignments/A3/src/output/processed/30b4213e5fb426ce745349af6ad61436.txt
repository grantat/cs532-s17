Jamiroquai Just Dropped a New Single and it's Pure Fire
Share Article
Jamiroquai just dropped a new single "Automation" from their
forthcoming album
, and we're very happy to say it's pretty fucking dope.
Like the track's title suggests, it's a funky, computerized-disco tune with Daft Punk inspired vocoded vocals that deserves to be listened to on full blast.
They've also released a a very cool video for "Automaton" that beings rather ominously with a nuclear explosion before cutting to footage of our heroes wandering in a post-apocalyptic world. Fitting, given the current political landscape.
The UK band's new LP,
Automaton
, is due for a March 31st release, which is when they're due to hit London for a show at The Roundhouse. They've also got upcoming dates in Paris on March 28th at La Salle Pleyel, and at several European festivals over the summer.
Check out the video below.
