Wonderful World
about
Fresh. Expressive. Unexpected.
Natalia’s mother once taught her, “No musical mistake is a mistake, but rather a journey to create beautiful music”. The singer, songwriter, pianist, and musical educator has emerged from the cocoon of the classical world to reach diverse audiences with her unique story and sound.
Taking inspiration from such distinctive artists as Dean Martin, Ella Fitzgerald, Judy Garland, Nina Simone and a touch of Mozart, Natalia blends her most powerful influences to create a new fusion of sound and soul. She delivers a bold take on the familiar sounds of classical, jazz, the standards, and Greek folk music.
Her debut album Life, released to iTunes in December of 2011, is full of soul-tinged songs that are set to resonate with all who hear them. Produced by Juno award winning engineer, Rob Shallcross, the album contains a variety of sounds, instruments, and guest vocals. Anchored together by her incredible voice and impressive piano skills, Natalia takes the listeners on a personal exploration of her life throughout the past 10 years.
