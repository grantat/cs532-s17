Event Details
From
Jackie Brown
to

, from film to live music, from Tarantino to full-on 70's funk blaxploitation party. THIS IS
The Soundcrash Funk & Soul Weekender
launch night from

...

THEME: Blaxpliotation movies, funk and a whole lotta soul...
We will be screening Tarantino’s terrific blaxploitation masterpiece Jackie Brown, followed by an epic 70’s funk and soul immersion party until 3am at
Mick's Garage
. Expect serious live music from
Brassroots
, who will be playing HITS from legends
George Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic
right through to the God Father of Soul himself,
James Brown
.
The theme is blaxpliotation movies of the 70's, so don’t be surprised if you bump into
Shaft
or
Super Fly
while you're slicing up the dance floor. Indeed funky dress is recommended, if you’re down (and those of you coming dressed as Tarantino characters get extra special treatment on the soul train.) As George Clinton would say, “the desired effect is what you get when you improve your interplanetary funksmanship...”

*** About Nightspot Cinema ***
Relive the history of modern music at Nightspot Cinema. We indulge in nostalgia for music through film and relive those moments and movements by dancing the night away in themed parties based around the sounds and style represented by the film.
We are the pop-up cinema that lives for the world of music and nightlife. If that’s your thing, come and spend the night with us and we’ll show you a different kind of party.

What is the Handling Charge for?
To ensure tickets are delivered safely and securely and to keep the price as low as possible for you, the ticket buyer, nightspotcinema generally uses our E-ticket system unless otherwise stated.
For this service we charge a small Handling Fee to cover the debit/credit card processing fees, customer services, processing and distribution of tickets and our secure server costs. We always try to keep these costs to an absolute minimum. If you feel at any time that our prices are not fair or competitive we'd be happy to hear from you.
Delivery
If you have ordered physical paper tickets there is a further Delivery cost added to cover the delivery of your order through the Royal Mail network.
We always endeavour to keep these costs as low as possible to merely cover the costs of postage. We only charge you one Delivery cost per order so if there is a big group of you recommend purchasing larger amounts in one order.
When you purchase tickets through nightspotcinema, the full face value of the ticket is shown. This price is the price set by the event promoter and we pay this full amount to the promoter without any deductions.
