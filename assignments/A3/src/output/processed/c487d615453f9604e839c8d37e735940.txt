You Must Believe in Spring, recorded in 1977, was the first album published after the death of Bill Evans, in 1980. Themes like absence, loss, death (so close to Bill, after the death of his brother, and his friend Scott La Faro) are expressed in the musical research & development of this cd, a pearl in his Jazz recording history. This is the title track, #2, You Must Believe in Spring.
