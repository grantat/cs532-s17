I graduated from a place called Whitworth College in Spokane with a theater degree, then in 1993 I moved to L.A. and auditioned and did very well there. My first gig was playing a skinhead in John Singleton’s ‘Higher Learning’, and I played Glenn Close’s son in a TV movie called ‘Serving In Silence.’

Jazz music and, more specifically, jazz musicians, are my artistic heroes. I want to be the Thelonious Monk of acting. He had no concern for how well he was received. He played whatever he wanted whenever he wanted. He just wasn’t interested in achieving the good opinion of his audience. That’s the Holy Grail of acting; of any art form.

I miss the physicality of drumming. There’s immediateness about it that I’m always striving for in my acting. Maybe I’m in the wrong profession. I certainly wish I could spend more time pursuing music. It feels like a part of me I’m neglecting.

I didn’t go out for a soap until I moved to New York. I wasn’t even considering soaps, but my agents talked me into it and said it’s nice, steady work.
