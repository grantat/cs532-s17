Ain't No Sunshine (When She's Gone)
Everyone agrees that jazz instrumental music is so relaxing. It's the same with pop instrumental. And everyone agrees that jazz music is better when it includes jazz saxophone.
Why not take some of the greatest pop songs ever written and record them as smooth jazz instrumental music? Ok - I did, and here they are, 1 hour of them.
You're going to love these songs for dinner music, studying music, relaxation music, sexy music; instrumental music for anytime and any place you need it mellow.
