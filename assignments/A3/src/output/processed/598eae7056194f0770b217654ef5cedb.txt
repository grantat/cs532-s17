KALEIDOSCOPIC
By
Steve Wyzard
on February 7, 2017
Format: Audio CD
Verified Purchase
What could Ralph Towner possibly have to add to his deep catalog in 2017, after 40+ years with ECM Records? Plenty, it turns out, and while some will grumble about the 40:28 running time, My Foolish Heart is proof positive that his unfettered guitar greatness has not even remotely diminished with age.
Towner's albums (even in the CD age) have never run long, and have rarely included a liner note like this one does. He tells us that the title track (and the Evans/LeFaro/Motian version in particular) had an "immeasurable impact" upon his formation as a musician, and that he "decided to pay a visit" to this "reverent musical space". It's one of this album's true highlights, and the only cover version among the other eleven which are his own compositions.
Long time listeners will recognize all of the classic Towner trademarks, from the angular, jagged lines of "Pilgrim" to the unbridled vigor of "Rewind". Everything is played with an overwhelming authority, and the impressionistic "wide-open-spaces-under-a-wild-sky" atmosphere is always present. This is familiar, well-trodden ground, but Towner's intuitive intellect always gives us something original and he continues to turn new pages. The relentless subtlety of "Dolomiti Dance" is this album's "wow-inspiring" stunner, but don't overlook the haunting nostalgia of "I'll Sing to You" or the searching ruminations of the shorter pieces. "Saunter", the longest track at 5:01, begins whimsically, but soon ventures toward probing bent notes and intense slides that are truly awe-inspiring.

Another Excellent Solo Guitar Recording by Ralph Towner
By

Format: Audio CD

My Foolish Heart continues Ralph Towner's series of excellent solo guitar recordings.  While there are many great guitarists, he has a unique combination of classical guitar, outstanding compositions, and improvisation.  I enjoy his recordings with Oregon and with other collaborators, but the solo recordings exhibit his talents best.

A stunning set of Towner solo guitar- an instant classic and an audiophile recording
By
Brian Whistler
VINE VOICE

Format: Audio CD

This may very well be Towner's strongest solo album yet. The ever prolific master has gifted us with 10 new originals, most written in his neo-classical style.  His playing is in top form- indeed Towner is one of those artists who has only improved with age. what you have here is a very listenable album, a kind of rainy day music for thoughtful listeners. It is anything but background music, although I suppose it could be listened to as such-repeated listenings reveal hidden depths.
The opening piece, Pilgrim, sets the tone for this mostly introspective set. It's all there: a strong melodic classical piece tinged with contemporary harmony and rhythm,  that familiar and specific world that only Towner seems to inhabit. There are two tunes on which Ralph plays his signature 12 string. It's great to hear that unique sound again. His reading of My Foolish Heart is as sweet and tender as Bill Evans's classic version. To close out the set, he plays a solo version of his Oregon composition, Rewind.
I just want to add that this may very well be the best recording yet of Ralph's custom nylon string. It's almost as if he's playing in my living room, with just the right amount of hall ambience to give the recording some needed space around the luscious notes.
Towner has done it again. An instant classic.
