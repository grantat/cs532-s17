Manchester band PINS on their collaboration with Iggy Pop
BBC 6 Music
Posted at

30 Jan
BBC
Manchester band
PINS
have been telling 6 Music about their new track with punk rock royalty Iggy Pop.
The track Aggrophobe is part of a new EP Bad Thing out on 24 February.
Sophie and Faith from the band said it was as simple as writing a letter.
"We had the idea that we wanted someone with a good speaking voice as well as a good singing voice and Iggy was our first choice so we just wrote him a letter.
"His manager just said he would put it front of him and it would be up to him. And he said 'Yes!'"
Not a great story then but a decent ending...

There will be 'slight changes' to the UK's Eurovision song

Eurovision: There will be 'slight changes' to UK entry
Eurovision hopeful Lucie Jones has admitted that there will be a little light tinkering made to her entrance into this year's competition in Kiev.
Apparently it comes from listening to what fans on social media are saying about the uber-ballad Never Give Up On You.
So, a verse from Stormzy perhaps?...Or maybe the return of Katrina and the Waves on backing vocals?
Stay tuned.

Like a great dance tune beat 'drop', he's had to wait for it...but
Pete Tong
has finally landed his first number one album.
His latest collection Classic House, which reworks Ibiza rave 'choons' with the help of the Heritage Orchestra and conductor Jules Buckley, was released nine weeks ago and took its time in getting to top spot on Friday.
Ed Sheeran held on to top spot in the singles charts (scroll down for more on Ed including a new video).
Here's Pete hosting Radio 1's Ibiza Prom at the Albert Hall in 2015, where no doubt the seed for the record was sewn.

US Crooner-come-La La Land actor
John Legend
has hit out at new President Donald Trump over his executive order banning immigration from seven countries.
During a speech at the
Producers Guild of America awards in LA on Saturday
, the indignant singer said: "Our vision of America is directly antithetical to that of President Trump,"
"I want to specifically tonight reject his vision and affirm that America has to be better than that.
Los Angeles is the home of so many immigrants, so many creative people, so many dreamers... Our America is big, it is free and it is open to dreamers of all races, all countries, all religions."
BBC
Other big names from around the music world including Rihanna, Win Butler of Arcade Fire and Questlove have also voiced their disapproval at Trump's decision to ban citizens and refugees from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States.
Rihanna said she is "disgusted"
and described the move as "devastating".
Fellow female pop stars Grimes and Sia are
encouraging their fans to donate money to help civil rights organisations
in light of the news, saying they will match any donations.

An American woman who was in intensive care after having her jaw smashed at a gig has criticised violence at music shows.
Emily Hoffman says she was assaulted at a gig by Code Orange in Salt Lake City, Utah.
"Some guy was there who decided to wear steel toe boots.
"He round house kicked me in the face. He hit my jaw so hard that it moved the entire thing to one side breaking it in two places on each side," Emily wrote on her
Facebook page
.
"When you hit someone in the face then you see her unconscious and you run off to not get caught. You're something else, I really don't have the words for what you are."
The hardcore band say they're talking to Emily and her family about what happened at their gig.

Watch Steve Lamacq re-visit the venue where he saw his first ever gig
BBC 6 Music
Posted at

30 Jan
Independent Venue Week wrapped up yesterday, completing seven days of celebrations of grassroots music venues.
As part of his Indie tour, 6 Music's Steve Lamacq re-visited some old haunts in his old patch Chelmsford, Essex and pondered the future of the music scene if smaller venues keep closing down.
His journey begins at Evoke, which was the old Chancellor Hall where, in September 1978, he saw his first ever live band...namely The Lurkers, aka "Britain's answer to the Ramones."
And the first ever band to sing to the Beggars Banquets label - the future home of artists like Gary Numan and Biffy Clyro.
As part of his Indie Venues tour, Steve catches up with the music scene in Chelmsford.

Steve Mason breathes fresh life into Beta Band anthems at Barbican
Paul Glynn
Music News LIVE reporter
Posted at

30 Jan
Elspeth Moore
What was your favourite folktronica album of last year?  I bet some of you haven't even got one have you? Be honest...
If you haven't dabbled in the genre before then don't be alarmed.  It's basically an acoustic singer-songwriter using something electronic, like a drum machine and/or sampler.
Since you asked my favourite was
Steve Mason
's Meet The Humans.  So I was intrigued to see how some of those songs would translate at the grand setting of the beautiful Barbican theatre in the City of London.
"Last time I was here was for a star wars convention!" says Steve.
Some of these songs are a bit tricky to play live. You either have to use a sampler...or this lot..."
Elspeth Moore
By 'this lot' he means his own band, accompanied for this special performance by a string and brass section, a harpist, two drummers (three at times when Steve bangs his bongos) and a trio of gospel vocalists - all expertly conducted by Manchester composer Joe Duddell.
Joe has previously given similar orchestral treatments to the likes of Elbow and New Order and his arrangement helps the former Beta Band and King Biscuit Time man (who shuns the smart theatre dress code in favour of a hoodie) to breathe new life into a career-straddling set.
Highlights of the first half include re-workings of Run Away, Hardly Go Through and Alive from his latest solo album, with the latter drawing a cry of "Choose life" from one wit in the crowd - a reference to the similarly life-affirming Trainspotting sequel released that evening which will have meant so much to a generation of fellow Scots like Steve.
Elspeth Moore
Like many people I first came across Steve's work in the
Beta Band courtesy of cult indie music film High Fidelity.
And the second half sees him (after a much-needed outfit change) run through a series of crowd-pleasing old BB favourites like Dr Baker and She's The One, written during a dark time time when the singer was "obsessed with Tony Blair"...and not in a good way.
A polite all-seated crowd sit obediently nodding (and shamefully shushing in some quarters) for the most part, perhaps confused by seeing their indie hero in such a theatrical setting.
However the joyous refrain of "Daydream, I fell asleep amid the flowers" from Squares sees the first signs of fans getting up on their feet.
Only with the euphoric call of the classic penultimate track Dry The Rain do tonight's theatre-goers break free of their shackles, spill out into the aisles and truly let go.
"If there's something inside that you wanna say, say it out loud it will be ok."
In these deeply divided political times, those roaringly empathetic chorus lines never felt more relevant.

As he demonstrated last week
with the announcement
of his new album,
James Blunt
is the undisputed King of Twitter.
Now he's been giving his tips on how to deal with the inevitable trolling that goes hand in hand with having an active social media account with more than 1.3m readers
"Don't be very emotional about it," he told Chris Evans on his Radio 2 Breakfast show earlier, "Because they are complete strangers who are tweeting from the privacy of their own home and they probably are lonely people".

Jamiroquai are back, with a new and improved cyber Jay Kay
Posted at
10:37
30 Jan
It's been seven years since the last album by Brit funk-acid jazzsters
Jamiroquai
and now they are back with a krautrock-inspired new sound in the track Automaton.
The impressive video sees frontman Jay Kay wandering around disused tube stations with an incredibly distracting new bit of headgear.
He's ditched the slightly-culturally appropriated native American headdress for a new hi-tech version which moves of its own accord.
The track is taken from the band's forthcoming eighth studio album and they are heading out on a whistle-stop European tour, which includes a UK date at London's Roundhouse.
