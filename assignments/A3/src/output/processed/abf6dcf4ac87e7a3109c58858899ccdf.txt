Market Commentary
by Scott J. Brown, Ph.D., Chief Economist
The economic data calendar was thin. December trade figures were roughly in line with expectations. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index fell in the mid-February estimate.
Stock market investors were encouraged by the prospect for tax cuts following comments by President Trump. In contrast, the bond market, recognizing that the process for cutting taxes will be contentious and lengthy, is less fearful of a large boost to the federal budget deficit (hence, bond yields have backed down over the past month).
Next week, there are several economic reports, but January figures are subject to a number of seasonal distortions. More importantly, Fed Chair Janet Yellen will deliver her semiannual monetary policy testimony on Tuesday and Wednesday. We may not learn much new regarding the outlook for rate increases (still expected to be gradual). Monetary policy will remain data-dependent. Lawmakers will likely try to pull Yellen into a discussion of fiscal policy (infrastructure spending and tax cuts), but she will steer clear of that. Many may see Yellen as something of a lame duck. Her term as Fed chair ends February 3, 2018. However, she will almost certainly have a lot to say about financial regulation.

	<p class="disclaimer">Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. There are special risks involved with global investing related to market and currency fluctuations, economic and political instability, and different financial accounting standards. There is no assurance that any trends mentioned will continue in the future. While interest on municipal bonds is generally exempt from federal income tax, it may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax, state or local taxes. In addition, certain municipal bonds (such as Build America Bonds) are issued without a federal tax exemption, which subjects the related interest income to federal income tax. Also municipal bonds may be subject to capital gains taxes if sold or redeemed at a profit. Investing involves risk and investors may incur a profit or a loss.</p>

    <p class="disclaimer">US government bonds and treasury bills are guaranteed by the US government and, if held to maturity, offer a fixed rate of return and guaranteed principal value. US government bonds are issued and guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest by the federal government. Treasury bills are certificates reflecting short-term (less than one year) obligations of the US government.</p>

    <p class="disclaimer">Commodities trading is generally considered speculative because of the significant potential for investment loss. Markets for commodities are likely to be volatile and there may be sharp price fluctuations even during periods when prices overall are rising.
