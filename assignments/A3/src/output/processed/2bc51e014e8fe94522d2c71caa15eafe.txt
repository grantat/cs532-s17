Jamiroquai have officially announced their comeback album, 'Automaton'.
The group
teased a forthcoming LP
last week and now they've revealed it'll be out on March 31 via Virgin EMI.
In support of the record, written and produced by Jay Kay and keyboardist Matt Johnson, they'll be playing a headline show at The Roundhouse in London on March 31. They also play in Paris on March 28 and Tokyo on March 25.
Of the album, Jay Kay says:
“
The inspiration for Automaton is in recognition of the rise of artificial intelligence and technology in our world today and how we as humans are beginning to forget the more pleasant, simple and eloquent things in life and in our environment including our relationship with one another as human beings."
