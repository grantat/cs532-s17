ABOUT SIOBHAN
The only thing that comes to a sleeping man is dreams ...Tupac
Heavily influenced by her uncle, Buster Cooper, a ten-year member of the famed Duke Ellington Band,   Siobhan has been dancing to jazz tunes well before she could walk. At the age of three she paired that dancing with singing in the Mt. Zion Missionary Baptist Church in Saint Petersburg, Florida.  Her love for music blossomed when she was introduced to classical arias and American folk and traditional music at John Hopkins Middle School, under the direction of music teacher, Stanley Butts. Encouraged by her music teacher to begin classical training and further her music studies, Siobhan attended the Pinellas County Center for the Arts. It was there that she began her classical training from voice teacher Dawn Eubanks. During her tenure at the PCCA, she received numerous awards and accolades, including being named a finalist in the
Walker Rising Stars
scholarship foundation and being a featured soloist at the National Holocaust Remembrance project in Washington D.C.
