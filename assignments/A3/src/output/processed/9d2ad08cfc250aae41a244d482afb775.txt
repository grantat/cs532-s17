Description or Lyrics and Chords
Am I love?
Every heart is beating
I'm all love
Can't you feel me feeling?
Take my hand
Cold like a junkie
I'm an ice cold man
(I'm an ice cold)
Why am I crying for you?
All this love I felt for you
Has gone away to another place
I put my faith in a digital world
Where they've given me
Eyes without a face
I'd steal the moon, on silver nights
Remind myself I am someone
My soul is numb and for tonight
(I'm Automaton)
I'm so tough
Can't you see me running
See I can touch
Can you feel me coming?
I see the world
And cry for freedom
These metal eyes, they can't disguise
The fact that I
(I need something to believe in)
But then I'm dying for you
I said goodbye to the world I knew
And took off into inner space
Weren't you the ones who promised me
A very different place
I've powered up, get my program set
And tilt my head toward the sun
Inside I know, I'm not a void
(I'm Automaton)
(Automaton [x4])
Hey, you got me down underground
Getting holed up in my cyber land
As if I had time to break that down
(Automaton)
Whatever you can do I can override it
Got a million ways to synthesize it
Digital android, I can fight it
(Fi-fi-fi-fight it out)
(Automaton [x4])
Feel like a man, who fell to Earth
That this is not where I belong
They rule my life from a metal box, that's windowless
And I wonder, where it all goes wrong
Maybe this dream will stay alive
But can the madness be undone?
Am I the new intelligence?
(I'm Automaton [x7])
You know I need something
I can hold on to
Hold on to
You were all I knew
(I'm Automaton)
I need something
I can hold on to
Hold on to
This was all I knew
(I'm Automaton)

Biography
Jamiroquai is a funk/acid jazz band which formed in London, England, United Kingdom in 1992. The band currently consists of Jason Luis 'Jay Kay' Cheetham  (vocals), Matt Johnson (keyboards), Rob Harris (guitar), Paul Turner (bass), Derrick McKenzie (drums) , Sola Akingbola (percussion), Lorraine McIntosh (backing vocals) and Hazel Fernandez (backing vocals). The name "Jamiroquai" is derived from the Native American Iroquois tribe, with which Kay has said he identifies philosophically, combined with 'Jam', as in musical jamming.
After Jay Kay auditioned unsuccessfully to be the singer of the Brand New Heavies, he decided to put together his own band. Jamiroquai's first single, "When You Gonna Learn?", was released in 1992 on the Acid Jazz label. Following its success, Kay signed a £1,000,000 eight-album record deal with Sony BMG Music Entertainment. The band enjoys worldwide popularity and is the best-known member of the early-1990s London-based acid jazz movement, alongside groups such as Incognito, Galliano, and Corduroy. Jamiroquai has since, however, moved in other musical directions.
