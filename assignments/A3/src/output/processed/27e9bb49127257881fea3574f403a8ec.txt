Lyrics:
This is a man's world
This is a man's world
But it would be nothing, nothing
Without a woman or a girl
You see, man made the car
To take us over the road
Man made the train
To carry the heavy load
Man made the electrolight
To take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water
Like Noah made The Ark
