Here And Now
These Motown instrumental songs are jazz music at it's best - a great combination of smooth music, classic songs, jazz saxophone, excellent vibe, and real soul.
It's great dinner music, study music (or music for studying), relaxation music, music for making love - in other words, music for any time you need something relaxing, mellow, romantic, sexy, or chill.
You can download smooth jazz (the songs on this video) here:

Enjoy!
