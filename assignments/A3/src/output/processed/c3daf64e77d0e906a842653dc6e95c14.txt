SCHWARZ & FUNK -
Serious Chillout & Soulful Lounge Music
Inspired by the Balearic House vibes of Ibiza the passionate producers Bob Schwarz and Jesse Funk established the musical project SCHWARZ & FUNK in 2001. Since then it has represented Deep Chillout and Soulful Lounge tunes loved by music enthusiasts all over the globe who are bored by tepid jingle-jangle mislabeled as Chillout and Lounge Music.
SCHWARZ & FUNK tracks are released worldwide on very well-known compilations such as the CafÃ© del Mar series. In addition the remixes of Bob and Jesse generate great international interest as well. They also compose and produce commercial tracks for many major international companies including Volkswagen, Alfa Romeo, Lufthansa, Tui, Orange, Pilates, Brita and more.
As professional and passionate musicians, Bob and Jesse frequently work together with outstanding musicians and singers. Their good friend and exceptional guitarist Joe T. Aykut for instance, can be regarded as their biggest asset. His spectacular solo performances are one key component of SCHWARZ & FUNK. Big stars like J.C.A., Barbara Tucker, The Gipsy Kings and even the Bee Gees have worked with him as well.
Wikipedia (
http://goo.gl/ITt8De):
Chill-out music (sometimes also chillout, chill out, or simply chill) is an umbrella term for several styles of electronic music characterized by their mellow style and mid-tempo beatsâ€”"chill" being derived from a slang injunction to "relax".
The genres associated with chill-out are mostly ambient, trip hop, nu jazz, ambient house and other subgenres of downtempo. Sometimes the easy listening subgenre lounge is considered to belong to the chill-out collection as well.
A number of compilations with "Chill Out" in their titles were released in the mid-1990s and beyond, helping to establish the genre as being closely related to downtempo and trip hop but also incorporating, especially in the early 2000s, slower tempo varieties of house music, nu-jazz, psybient, and lounge music of approximately 80 to 110bpm . The genre also includes some forms of trance music, ambient music, and IDM, and it has entirely subsumed the older genre Balearic Beat, although that term is still used interchangeably with chill out.

The range of lounge music encompasses beautiful music-influenced instrumentals, modern electronica (with chillout and downtempo influences), while remaining thematically focused on its retro-space-age cultural elements. Contemporaneously, the term lounge music may also be used to describe the types of music played in hotels (lounge, bar) casinos and piano bars.
