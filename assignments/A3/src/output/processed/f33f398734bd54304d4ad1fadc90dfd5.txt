Flag Abuse
Flagging a post will send it to the Goodreads Customer Care team for review.
  We take abuse seriously in our discussion boards.
  Only flag comments that clearly need our attention.
  As a general rule we do not censor any content on the site.
  The only content we will consider removing is spam,
  slanderous attacks on other members,
  or extremely offensive content (eg. pornography, pro-Nazi, child abuse, etc).
  We will not remove any content for bad language alone, or being critical
  of a particular book.
