Comeback: Jamiroquai release their brand new single
Jamiroquai/Facebook
Jamiroquai
have released their first new music in seven years with comeback single Automaton.
The acid jazz funk group dropped the brand new track on Friday, alongside a Charlie Lightening-directed video.
Their first new material since 2010’s Rock Dust Light Star sees a return to form for the Jay Kay-fronted band ahead of a string of festival dates this summer.
Speaking about the track, he said: “The inspiration for Automaton is in recognition of the rise of artificial intelligence and technology in our world today and how we as humans are beginning to forget the more pleasant, simple and eloquent things in life and in our environment including our relationship with one another as human beings.”
The band have also announced a UK and European tour, kicking off in Paris in March and finishing in Portugal in July.
They are set to play in Japan and South Korea in May, followed by appearances in Greece, The Netherlands, Italy, Finland and France during the summer.
