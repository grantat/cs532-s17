Phoenix FM Interview with Chris Siviter - The Fourth WallThe Fourth Wall UK

‚öí Reece Brooks ‚öí
One thing we desperately need to do is stop making our transfer activity public. By that I mean David Sullivan needs to stop throwing names & figures into the public eye. Look at Bacca for example. He must have seen that we were willing to offer Tevez extortionate wages, so wanted a big wages packet too!
Antonio. I love the bloke. Every West Ham fan does. Him playing at right-back is just devastating. Not only is he not a defender, his confidence is being broken!
