Released on January 27, and already with more than 2 million views,
Jamiroquai
are back with a new song, video and album after a 7-year hiatus.
In Jay Kay´s words:
“The inspiration for
Automaton
is in recognition of the rise of artificial intelligence and technology in our world today and how we as humans are beginning to forget the more pleasant, simple, and eloquent things in life and in our environment including our relationship with one another as human beings,”
Their 8th album, also called
Automaton
,  brings the signature funk style back, but the sound is feisty, it is poignant and incisive. Funk, not the smooth “Corner of the Earth” style, but reminiscent of “Deeper Underground” and how it hit the dance floor with angst energy. Love it, love him. Can´t wait to hear the new album.
