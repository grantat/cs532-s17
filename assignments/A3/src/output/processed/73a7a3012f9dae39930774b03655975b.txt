James Brown performs "There was a Time", live at the Boston Garden on April 5th, 1968.
In the aftermath of Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination on April 4th, 1968, rioting broke out in cities across the country.  James Brown had been scheduled to perform at the Boston Garden on April 5th.  Boston Mayor, Kevin White had initially wanted to cancel all public events, including James Brown's show.  As there was concern that the cancellation of the show might cause an escalation of the crisis. it was agreed that James Brown's show would go on.
The show, one of the greatest in Boston's history, went on and the city of Boston remained relatively calm. James Brown consoled his mourning audience, dedicated the show to the memory of Dr. King and was instrumental in keeping the peace on the streets of Boston. This concert became known as " The Night James Brown Saved Boston"
"There Was a Time" was written by James Brown and recorded in July 1967 during a live performance at the Apollo Theater in a medley with "Let Yourself Go" and "I Feel All Right", and was first released November 1967 in edited form as the B-side of the single "I Can't Stand Myself (When You Touch Me)". The song charted #3 R&B; and #36 Pop.
Video transcript:
James Brown:  Hey, hey, hey. hey.  Alright, alright, alright, alright.  You know I got you alright.  Now there was a day.  There was a time. There was a time when I used to play.
