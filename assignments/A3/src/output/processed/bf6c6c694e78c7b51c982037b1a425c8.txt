We love going to live music venues in the Phoenix area and since jazz has a special place in our hearts, we are sharing our recommended spots with you!
Kazimierz World Wine Bar
7137 E Stetson Dr. (Stetson is 1 block southwest of Camelback and Scottsdale Roads)
Scottsdale, AZ
It will be hard to find the bar from the street so you have to Valet Park and just ask the Valet where the bar is. It will be worth the trouble.
The Nash
110 E. Roosevelt St.
Phoenix, AZ
Amazing jazz venue in the downtown Phoenix area. National and local jazz artists performing and great jam sessions. Visit
www.thenash.org
for more information.
Musical Instrument Museum (MIM) Music Theater
4725 E. Mayo Boulevard
Phoenix, AZ 85050
The MIM Music Theater hosts some of the best jazz concerts in town. National and local jazz artists perform at the MIM Music Theater all year round. Visit
mimmusictheater.themim.org
for upcoming shows.
Michael’s at Park Central
3110 N Central Ave., Suite 140
Phoenix, AZ 85012
Smooth jazz on Wednesday nights. One of the best places in the Phoenix area to meet mature urban professionals. Check
michaelsatparkcentral.com
for entertainment updates.
The Womack
5749 N 7th Street
Phoenix, AZ 85014
Great live R&B, jazz, blues and music on select nights. Good drinks. Nice patio. The vibe of The Womack is inspired by the legendary “Chez Nous” cocktail lounge that used to be in Phoenix for many years. Small, cozy and classy.
Lakeshore Music Concert Series at the Tempe Center for the Arts
700 W. Rio Salado Parkway
Tempe, AZ  85281
The Lakeshore Music Concert series will host a number of celebrated national jazz artists in 2016-17. Check
lakeshoremusic.org/tca/
for upcoming acts.
Sanctuary Camelback Mountain
5700 East McDonald Drive
Paradise Valley, Arizona
Live performances by jazz, pop, and R&B vocalists at the Jade Bar make this one of the best date spots in the Valley of the Sun. The views are spectacular.
