Location. Location. Location. It matters to advisors as well as realtors.
With Raymond James Financial’s purchase of Alex. Brown from Deutsche Bank, its San Francisco-based advisors have moved up to the 45th floor of a downtown skyscraper, near where they had worked before becoming part of the German bank.

“To have such a significant percentage of these advisors choose to continue to be affiliated with Alex. Brown and become part of the Raymond James family not only speaks about the power of the combination but also … creates tremendous pride within Raymond James more broadly,” the Raymond James & Associates, Private Client Group president explained.
Elwyn knows the Alex. Brown reps had “their choice” of firms to move to, if they wanted to depart. “They had all firms in the profession knocking on their door and inviting them to join,” he said. “But so many chose to stay and grow their business with Raymond James, which reflects quite positively on the broader organization. We are thrilled with the retention results.”

Mallon says clients he is in touch with “have been overwhelmingly positive.” The reason for this outcome, he believes, is communication. “We did lots of communicating with clients and talked about expectations, so we kept them updated … and solicited their input, as well,” said the executive during an interview in the firm’s Bay Area office.
Advisor Melinda Fishel sees the Raymond James’ platform as “perfect for my clients,” says the San Francisco-based rep. “The biggest positive is the number of resources and team members in place. The systems are great.”
