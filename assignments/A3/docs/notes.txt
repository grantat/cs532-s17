Inverted Index notes:
Numbers over 4 digits were generally not often found. While single digits ,especially 1 standalone, was found very frequently in documents.

Emojis were scarce but atleast they were found.

Overall what can be taken away from my Inverted index is that the longer a word or phrase was, the least likely it was to be repeated in a document.

Full years like 2010, 2011, 2012 up to 2017, actuaully showed a correlation of rising occurence in documents. The closer the year was to the current year, 2017, it was more likely to be shown.
