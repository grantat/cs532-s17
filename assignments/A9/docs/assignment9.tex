% First question
% =================================
\section*{1}

\subsection*{Question}

\begin{verbatim}
1.  Choose a blog or a newsfeed (or something similar with an Atom
or RSS feed).  Every student should do a unique feed, so please
"claim" the feed on the class email list (first come, first served).
It should be on a topic or topics of which you are qualified to
provide classification training data.  Find something with at least
100 entries (or items if RSS).

Create between four and eight different categories for the entries
in the feed:

examples: 

work, class, family, news, deals

liberal, conservative, moderate, libertarian

sports, local, financial, national, international, entertainment

metal, electronic, ambient, folk, hip-hop, pop

Download and process the pages of the feed as per the week 12 
class slides.

Be sure to upload the raw data (Atom or RSS) to your github account.
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{Answer}

For this problem I decided to use Realm's RSS feed, a news feed for mobile development \cite{realmref}. I had 7 categories to classify this feed which were: iOS, Android, React Native, Realm News, Databases, Nodejs and Xamarin. These categories mostly describe the topics that were found in these news feeds. Realm News was used to describe topics that weren't particularly programming fields or platforms but just generic news topics. Realm's RSS feed originally had approximately 700 items, I decided to take the most recent 100 items with the full list shown in my github repository \cite{github}. The 100 items used in this assignment are shown in Listing \ref{}. One thing I noticed before starting the subsequent problems was that a lot of the descriptions used common terms but in different context. For example, ``Reactive programming'' is not a synonym for ``React Native'' which was a programming language, this lead me to think that the classifier would later get these categories wrong frequently.

To get Realm's RSS feed I used the methods created in \textbf{getFeed.py}. The manual classification of the 100 RSS feed items was created in a seperate text file called \textbf{classifiedFeeds.txt}. This was used later for speeding up running the python script.

% Second question
% =================================

\section*{2}

\subsection*{Question}

\begin{verbatim}
2.  Train the Fisher classifier on the first 50 entries (the "training
set"), then use the classifier to guess the classification of the
next 50 entries (the "test set").

Assess the performance of your classifier in each of your categories
by computing precision, recall, and F-measure.  Use the "macro-averaged"
label based method, as per:

http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/21551/how-to-compute-precision-recall-for-multiclass-multilabel-classification

For example, if you have 5 categories (e.g., 80s, metal,
alternative, electronic, cover), you will compute 
precision, recall, and F-measure for each category,
and then compute the average across the 5 categories.
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{Answer}

To solve this I used the python code provided from the Programming Collective Intelligence book described in the files \textbf{docclass.py} and \textbf{feedfilter.py}. I had to slightly modify docclass's first dependency to compile in python 3. I altered feedfilter's code heavily, creating new dictionaries for each of the classifier's guesses and actual answers as shown in Listing \ref{lst:q1feedfilter}. Feedfilter extracted the title and description from each item in the RSS feed and would concatenate the two which would then be used for classifying and training, if the iteration count was lower than the desired train count which was defined as \textit{trainCount}. Realm's RSS feed also had some items with quotation marks, emoji icons and img html tags. To compensate for this, I created two methods \textit{remove_emojis} and \textit{remove_img_tags} which removed these unwanted items before guessing or training based on the text.
